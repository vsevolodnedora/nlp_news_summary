**Today, 2 June 2025, the 11th Energy Infrastructure Forum has kicked off in Copenhagen. CINEA is actively participating in this year’s edition, contributing to high-level discussions on the challenges of accelerating the deployment of Europe’s energy infrastructure which will enable the achievement of EU’s decarbonisation targets. The Agency has taken this opportunity to celebrate the symbolic signature of five grant agreements with projects co-funded under CEF Energy.**
Organised by the European Commission in cooperation with the Danish Ministry of Climate, Energy and Utilities, the Energy Infrastructure
As in previous editions, CINEA plays an active role in the event. The Agency’s Director, Paloma Aba Garrote, spoke at the session _‘Delivery of the EU’s Grid Action Plan and way forward’_. In her intervention, she explained some of the challenges faced by the PCIs supported by CEF Energy and shared examples of best practices for overcoming them effectively. She also highlighted the crucial contribution of those projects to increase the European electricity transmission grid capacity by around 100 GW, while supporting the integration of renewables and the overall modernisation and digitalisation of electricity infrastructure. 
CINEA has also seized this important occasion to celebrate a symbolic ceremony marking the signature of the grant agreements between the Agency and the beneficiaries of 5 projects. 
These projects were selected under the 2024 CEF Energy call for PCIs and PMIs, where the [EU showed its continued commitment](https://cinea.ec.europa.eu/news-events/news/cef-energy-eur-125-billion-allocated-41-cross-border-energy-infrastructure-projects-2025-01-29_en)
The five projects showcased in the ceremony in the Forum are: 
  * **The Italian H2 Backbone** project, led by SNAM RETE GAS SPA, will receive a EUR 24 million grant for engineering and environmental studies to advance the development of hydrogen transmission infrastructure in Italy. This key project aims to lay the foundation for a southern European hydrogen corridor, enabling the transport of renewable hydrogen and supporting the EU's broader hydrogen strategy.
  * The [**H2 Readiness of the TAG pipeline system – Conceptual Engineering & FEED preparation**](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251567/101223569/CEF2027?order=DESC&pageNumber=1&pageSize=50&sortBy=es_SortDate&isExactMatch=true&frameworkProgramme=43251567&topicAbbreviation=CEF-E-2024-PCI-PMI-STUDIES) project, coordinated by TAG GMBH, has been allocated EUR 1.38 million. The funding will support detailed engineering studies to assess how to retrofit the existing Trans Austria Gas (TAG) pipeline in Austria for hydrogen transport, enhancing regional flexibility and interconnectivity within Central Europe.
  * The [**Offshore Wind Connection South Brittany**](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251567/101223626/CEF2027?order=DESC&pageNumber=1&pageSize=50&sortBy=es_SortDate&isExactMatch=true&frameworkProgramme=43251567&topicAbbreviation=CEF-E-2024-PCI-PMI-STUDIES) project will be implemented by Réseau de Transport d'Électricité (RTE) with a grant of EUR 21.8 million. This investment will support technical studies and permitting for the offshore grid connecting future floating wind farms to South Brittany, helping to accelerate renewable energy deployment in the French North Atlantic Sea Basin.
  * The **Interconnection between Navarra (ES) and Landes (FR)** has been awarded EUR 11.1 million. The project, a joint initiative between Spain and France,
  * Lastly, the **Modernisation of the hydro pumped storage plant of Čierny Váh** , led by Slovenské elektrárne a.s., will receive EUR 2.1 million. This project will support technical and financial feasibility studies to upgrade Slovakia’s largest hydro pumped storage facility, improving its efficiency and capacity to provide clean, flexible storage to balance increasing shares of renewables in the grid.


On this occasion, Paloma Aba Garrote, Director of CINEA, stated:
>   
> _“We at CINEA are proud to include all these projects in our portfolio as they are vital for advancing the implementation of the related Projects of Common Interest. They will directly contribute to enhancing Europe’s competitiveness, integrating energy markets and decarbonising our energy systems.”_
The five awarded projects underscore the pivotal role of CEF Energy in unlocking cross-border solutions for tomorrow’s energy challenges.

On Monday, 7 July, Commissioner for Energy and Housing Dan Jørgensen
This is the Commissioner's first visit to a nuclear power facility after the recently adopted [eighth nuclear illustrative programme](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/publications/communication-nuclear-illustrative-programme-under-article-40-euratom-treaty_en) (‘PINC'). This programme estimates the [investment needs of the sector](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/nuclear-energy/nuclear-investment-needs_en) towards 2050 and describes the contribution of nuclear energy to achieving decarbonisation and to guaranteeing industrial competitiveness and security of supply.
As part of the visit, the Commissioner will also meet with the new chairman and chief of EDF to discuss the opportunities and challenges faced by the sector, including necessary investments and the importance of high standards for safety, security and environmental protection.
A press point is foreseen at the end of the meeting and will be available later on [EBS](https://audiovisual.ec.europa.eu/en/ebs/live/1). Photo coverage of the visit will also be available later this afternoon on the [Commission's audiovisual portal](https://commission.europa.eu/about/organisation/college-commissioners/calendar-items-president-and-commissioners_en?f%5B0%5D=commissioner_dynamic_commissioner_dynamic%3Ahttp%3A//publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/political-leader/COM_00006AAAF26A&f%5B1%5D=ewcms_calendar_status%3Aupcoming).

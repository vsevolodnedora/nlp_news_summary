# Call for evidence on update to Security of Gas Supply Regulation risk groups 
The Commission has published a [4 week call for evidence on a draft delegated regulation updating the composition of risk groups](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14244-Security-of-gas-supply-composition-of-risk-groups-update-_en) as foreseen under Article 3 of the [Security of Gas Supply Regulation 2017/1938](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32017R1938&qid=1752843851238). The draft foresees adjustments to the current composition, as listed under Annex I, taking account of the significant changes to EU gas supply since 2021 and the evolution of the major transnational risks to security of gas supply. In broad terms it maintains 4 risk groups, but introduces significant simplification. 
Member States have already been consulted through the Gas Coordination Group (GCG), and there will be a further consultation of the GCG in the wake of this public feedback exercise. The aim is for the Commission to publish the final delegated regulation before the end of this year. This will then be subject to the normal 2-month Council and European Parliament period of scrutiny. The call for evidence runs until 14 August 2025.

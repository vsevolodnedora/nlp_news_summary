Marking 3 years since the launch of the REPowerEU Plan, [the Commission takes stock of progress](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/markets-and-consumers/actions-and-measures-energy-prices/repowereu-3-years_en) towards cleaner, more autonomous and affordable energy.
The plan set out measures to phase out Russian fossil fuels, while speeding up the clean energy transition with more emphasis on renewable energy, energy efficiency and saving energy. 
As a result of EU measures, since May 2022
  * Imports of Russian gas dropped from 150 billion cubic meters (bcm) in 2021 to 52 bcm in 2024 – with the share of Russian gas imports falling from 45% to 19%.
  * Crude oil
  * EU countries operating Russian designed nuclear reactors (VVERs) are increasingly turning to non-Russian alternatives.


In parallel, the EU continues to roll out renewable energy.
The EU has also revised its rules on energy efficiency. EU countries agreed to further reduce their energy consumption by additional 11.7% by 2030 and create incentives for more energy-efficient buildings, supported by EU financing.
However, the EU is still importing Russian sources of energy, with revenues fuelling Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine. As a response, the Commission published a [REPowerEU Roadmap](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52025DC0440R%2801%29&qid=1747125158211) on 6 May 2025, announcing measures to cut off remaining gas, oil and nuclear imports from Russia in a gradual and coordinated way. 
The Roadmap will be followed by legislative proposals by the Commission in June 2025. The proposals aim to ban or restrict contracts with Russian gas suppliers. It also foresees trade measures on Russian imports of enriched uranium and new actions to address Russia's shadow fleet transporting oil. There will also be new rules on transparency, monitoring

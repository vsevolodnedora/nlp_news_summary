# Commission launches second mid-term round for coordinated gas purchases via AggregateEU to ensure stability and predictability of supplies

Today, the Commission is launching the second mid-term matching round to coordinate gas purchases under the [AggregateEU](https://wayback.archive-it.org/12090/20240909152832/https:/energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/energy-security/eu-energy-platform/aggregateeu-questions-and-answers_en) platform.
Buyers from the EU and the Energy Community will be able to submit and aggregate their gas demand for multiple 6-month periods running from July 2025 until October 2030 and access competitive offers from reliable international suppliers. To participate in this mid-term tender, demand must be submitted by 17 March, and will be put out to tender for expression of interest by potential suppliers from 18 to 21 March. After the demand and supply is matched through the platform, the individual companies negotiate their contract bilaterally.
Commissioner for Energy and Housing, Dan Jørgensen, said _:_
> 'While we continue to pursue the energy transition, ensuring predictable gas supplies for our Union remains key in these turbulent times. If we put our market weight together, our companies can access stable offers at better conditions. Until we fully decarbonise our economies and societies, this will not only help guarantee the security of energy supply, but also strengthen our competitiveness.'
Mid-term rounds on AggregateEU are a service offered by the Commission to ensure **stability and predictability of gas supplies** beyond the short-term crisis the EU faced during the past years. Crucially, this new mid-term tender shows our continued determination to diversifying our energy supplies away from Russia. 
This latest round builds on a hugely successful first mid-term round which took place from in February 2024, when offers almost tripled the demand submitted by EU companies. It also builds on the previous short-term rounds that since 2023 managed to match 42 billion cubic meters of demand requests and offers.
AggregateEU is the Commission’s flagship initiative for demand aggregation and coordinated gas purchasing at the European level as part of the [EU Energy Platform](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/energy-security/eu-energy-platform_en), launched in April 2023, to make the EU’s **energy supply more** **diverse, secure and coordinated**. Under the provisions of the Hydrogen and Decarbonised gases package, the Commission is now working on the establishment of a permanent instrument for the joint purchasing of gas and of other similar mechanisms for the demand aggregation of important commodities such as hydrogen and critical raw materials.

The Commission has today launched a [4-week call for evidence](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14617-Nuclear-illustrative-programme_en) related to the investment needs of the nuclear power sector in the EU. Seen as an important part of the consultative process and an opportunity for input from stakeholders and the public, the feedback received through this exercise will feed into the Commission’s work in preparing the update of the **Nuclear Illustrative Programme (PINC)** , which is foreseen for publication before the end of 2025. The period to provide feedback is open until 12 May.
The key objective of the PINC update will be to provide an up-to-date comprehensive, fact-based**overview of nuclear energy investments across the EU in line with decarbonisation targets and the**[**REPowerEU**](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal/repowereu-affordable-secure-and-sustainable-energy-europe_en)**and**[**Clean Industrial Deal**](https://commission.europa.eu/topics/eu-competitiveness/clean-industrial-deal_en)**goals**. By covering the full lifecycle of nuclear installations, the programme will identify investment trends, needs, and challenges in the sector, based on objectives pursued by EU countries.
PINC also seeks to stimulate action by stakeholders and facilitate coordinated development of their investments in nuclear energy. In particular, the updated PINC aims to
  * clarify relevant investment needs for both new-build projects and lifetime extensions of existing reactors
  * identify development and investment needs essential for responsible spent fuel and radioactive waste management and for a robust supply chain
  * provide an overview of innovative nuclear technologies (SMRs, fusion) currently under development in the EU and highlight opportunities and potential challenges associated with developing and deploying them
  * highlight needs associated with key enablers in the nuclear sector, including: (i) national regulatory capacity; (ii) transparency and public engagement; (iii) skills/ workforce gaps; and (iv) international collaboration


The proposed initiative will also seek to document and analyse several key challenges, including
  * the EU’s retention of its strategic leadership in the global nuclear sector
  * vulnerabilities in the EU supply chain
  * limited market uptake and slow commercialisation of innovative nuclear technologies
  * access to financing
  * attracting new talent and retraining the existing workforce


## Background 
It is 8 years since the [last assessment](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52017DC0237) of investment needs in the nuclear sector. Since then, the EU’s energy and nuclear landscape has undergone significant changes, driven by the EU’s decarbonisation agenda and increased emphasis on competitiveness, affordability, security of supply, and innovation. The need to update the PINC was identified in the [Action Plan for Affordable Energy](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/publications/action-plan-affordable-energy-unlocking-true-value-our-energy-union-secure-affordable-efficient-and_en) (under Action 5 ‘Completing the Energy Union’), and confirmed in the Commission Work Programme for 2025.

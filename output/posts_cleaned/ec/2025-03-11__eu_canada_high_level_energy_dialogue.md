Today, senior officials from Natural Resources Canada and the European Commission Directorate-General for Energy, Associate Deputy Minister Jeff Labonté and Director-General Ditte Juul Jørgensen, met in Houston to reaffirm their commitment to revitalising exchanges under the [EU-Canada High-Level Energy Dialogue](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/international-cooperation/key-partner-countries-and-regions/canada_en#eu-canada-high-level-energy-dialogue).
The two partners recalled their strong partnership and endorsed key areas of mutual interest to boost bilateral trade of energy and energy technologies, enhance energy security, and accelerate the clean energy transition. Recalling bilateral efforts and actions in the energy space over the past five years, including the joint statement of the [Canada-European Union Summit 2023](https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/news/statements/2023/11/24/canada-european-union-summit-2023-leaders-joint-statemen), Canada and the EU agreed to collaborate more closely going forward to strengthen clean and resilient energy supply chains, advance mutual priorities in multilateral fora (including the G7 under Canada’s presidency), explore cooperation through the Global Energy Transitions Forum, and ensure continued support for Ukraine. 
The two partners stand together in our commitment to foster sustainable growth, competitiveness, and prosperity for both Canada and the EU.

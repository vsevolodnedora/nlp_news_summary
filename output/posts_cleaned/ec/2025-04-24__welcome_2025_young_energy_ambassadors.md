We are pleased to introduce an inspiring new cohort of changemakers: the 2025 Young Energy Ambassadors, who are dedicated to driving the clean energy transition. 
This year, the [_Young Energy Ambassadors_](https://sustainable-energy-week.ec.europa.eu/young-energy-ambassadors_en) (YEA) programme saw a record number of applications, with over 1 300 submissions. After careful selection, 30 individuals have been chosen to represent the next generation of clean energy leaders for a one-year mandate. 
Hailing from a wide range of backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives, these young leaders are resolutely committed to advancing Europeâ€™s clean energy transition. From raising awareness to leading local initiatives and contributing to policy-making, they will play an active role in shaping the clean energy landscape in the year ahead.

Next week (10-12 June), the European Commission is hosting the [EU Sustainable Energy Week](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/yearly-energy-policy-events-and-forums/eu-sustainable-energy-week_en) (EUSEW), a 3-day policy conference centered around Europe's transition towards competitive, clean and affordable energy for its citizens and businesses.
This year the conference will be focusing on 'Powering a fair and competitive green transition.' 
On 10 June, Commissioner for Energy and Housing, Dan Jørgensen, will open the conference with a keynote speech. Executive Vice-President for a Clean, Just and Competitive Transition, Teresa Ribera, will then participate in the [EUSEW awards ceremony](https://sustainable-energy-week.ec.europa.eu/awards_en) to acknowledge outstanding individuals and projects for their contribution to the clean energy transition. In the afternoon, Commissioner for Climate, Net Zero and Clean Growth, Wopke Hoekstra, will deliver a keynote speech on the [Clean Industrial Deal](https://commission.europa.eu/topics/eu-competitiveness/clean-industrial-deal_en).
As part of the conference, Commissioner Jørgensen will also hold a [dialogue](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/events/implementation-dialogue-permitting-renewable-energy-projects-and-related-infrastructure-2025-06-11_en) with various actors to discuss the implementation of EU legislation that is key to speed up and simplify permitting processes for renewable energy projects. Accelerating the rollout of clean energy infrastructure is a key element of the EU’s plans to lower energy prices and boost competitiveness. 
EUSEW is the biggest annual event in Europe dedicated to renewables and energy efficiency. It engages each year more than 10 000 participants including policymakers, industry representatives, businesses, civil society organisations and citizens. 
Both in person and online attendance are possible via [registration](https://interactive.eusew.eu/register/). The [full programme](https://interactive.eusew.eu/eusew-2025/programme/) is available online.

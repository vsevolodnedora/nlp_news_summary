The European Commission has published the [**first list of Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) and Projects of Mutual Interest (PMIs)**](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R1041&qid=1712586379310) in the Official Journal of the European Union. The selected projects will help to achieve the ambitious energy and climate objectives of the European Green Deal.
The 166 projects on the list will benefit from streamlined permit-granting and regulatory support, and makes them eligible for EU financing from the [Connecting Europe Facility](https://ec.europa.eu/energy/topics/infrastructure/projects-common-interest/funding-for-PCIs_en) (CEF). For the new projects to apply for EU funding, the Commission will launch a first call for PCIs and PMIs before the second half of April 2024, with a deadline at the end of October 2024.
Once in force, the list will replace the 5th PCI list with a renewed focus on the energy infrastructure needed for a climate-neutral energy system for the future. The new list includes projects connecting the energy networks of EU countries and, for the first time, projects of mutual interest (PMIs) with non-EU countries.
Out of the 166 selected PCIs and PMIs, over half (85) are electricity, offshore and smart electricity grid projects, with many expected to be commissioned between 2027 and 2030. These projects will enable EU countries to reach their goal of installing 111 GW of offshore renewable energy by 2030 and more than 300 GW by 2050 as well as rapid electrification as underlined in the revised TEN-E Regulation and will help to double of renewable electricity production.
65 hydrogen and electrolyser projects are included in the list to help decarbonise EU industry as it replaces the use of natural gas with hydrogen and biomethane in the gas system. The list also features 14 CO2 network projects in line with EU goals to create a market for carbon capture and storage.
Rapid implementation of the 85 projects on electricity transmission, storage and smart grid cross-border is supported by the [European Grid Action Plan](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/infrastructure/trans-european-networks-energy_en#european-grid-action-plan), which sets out ways to remove bottlenecks and roll out grids for the energy transition in a faster and more efficient way.
The Commission will work closely with EU countries, project promoters, regulators and the wider stakeholder community to help the fast implementation of these key projects in line with the stronger measures of the Grid Action Plan.
## Background
The list published in the Official Journal is first Union list of PCIs and PMIs established under the revised TEN-E Regulation, in force since June 2022 and the sixth supported by EU trans-European energy networks policy. The publication of the list follows the end of the scrutiny period for the co-legislators, which confirmed their support for the list. The list will enter into force on the 20th day after its publication.
The revised TEN-E Regulation ensures that EU-supported cross-border energy infrastructure projects help the Union achieve its climate and energy goals as set out in the European Green Deal. The regulation requires the selection of priority projects to be included in the Union list of projects of common interest (PCI) and projects of mutual interest (PMI). It also set rules on permitting and regulatory incentives aimed at timely implementation of the projects on the Union list. It also includes rules for cross-border allocation of costs and determines conditions for EU financial assistance to the projects on the Union list.
As set out in the TEN-E Regulation, such lists are adopted every 2 years, following extensive stakeholder consultation in regional groups which are established by the TEN-E regulation.

START, the technical assistance facility of the European Commission’s [Initiative for coal regions in transition](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/oil-gas-and-coal/eu-coal-regions-transition_en) has come to an end after 6 years, leaving tangible results for many regions transitioning to clean energy. Since its inception in 2019, START has successfully undertaken 18 assignments covering 14 coal, lignite, peat and oil shale regions (so-called 'coal+' regions) in 10 EU countries, that have supported a wide diversity of territories and stakeholders.
To mark this achievement, a [START 'lessons learned' report](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/0b390348-5aed-11f0-a9d0-01aa75ed71a1/language-en) has been published. 
START’s work has included providing advice and guidance on the development of regional and local-level transition strategies, the identification and scoping of transition projects, and building of capacities and knowledge sharing within and among coal+ regions. Aligning with the EU’s ambition to drive a just transition, the START programme has equipped regions with the know-how and tools to diversify their economies to promote sustainability and competitiveness, to reshape their labour markets, foster green energy, enhance transition governance, and mobilise and engage affected citizens and stakeholders.
Given the differences in coal+ regions’ assets, socio-economic structure, industrial base and heritage, and institutional structures, START was designed to be a responsive and context-based instrument, with a focus on tailored solutions adapted to regional needs.
According to its beneficiaries, the programme’s strengths included its emphasis on the co-creation of solutions and deliverables, access to responsive hands-on expertise, building of relationships among regional, national and EU partners, and the creation of outputs with practical applicability which will have a legacy. 
From beginning to end, START has helped in providing a just transition. In collaboration with the recipient regions, the START programme has generated over 80 written outputs including, among others _,_ transition pathway plans, renewable energy reports, project files and detailed capacity building guidance. Many of these outputs are public and can be accessed online.
The Commission will continue its support to Coal regions in transition, with a renewed emphasis on supporting the competitiveness of the coal, peat and oil shale regions. A[ tender for the Secretariat to the initiative](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/tender-details/407e176e-8436-4aa2-a4f3-e6485b402921-CN?order=DESC&pageNumber=1&pageSize=50&sortBy=startDate&isExactMatch=true&cftPartyLegalEntityId=47352336) for the next 4 years has recently been launched. Requests for technical assistance can also be solicited under the EU-funded [TARGET programme](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/clean-energy-transition/eu-coal-regions-transition/target-technical-assistance_en). 
## Background
The START programme is part of the European Commission's [Initiative for coal regions in transition](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/oil-gas-and-coal/eu-coal-regions-transition_en). It was implemented by a consortium of partners comprising Ecorys, Climate Strategies, ICLEI and Wuppertal Institute.

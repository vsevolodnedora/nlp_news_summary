Today (21 May 2025) is the deadline for the transposition of a series of key provisions to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy, as required under in the revised [Renewable Energy Directive](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/renewable-energy/renewable-energy-directive-targets-and-rules/renewable-energy-directive_en).
Agreed by the co-legislators in 2023 and in force since 20 November 2023, the ultimate ambition of the directive is to achieve the EU's renewable target for 2030 of at least 42.5%, with the ambition to aim for 45%. This objective will require a concerted effort by the end of this decade - the latest official figures show a share of 24.5% in the EU energy mix in 2023. Given the relatively slow progress seen in some sectors at the time that the directive was being revised, the new legislation strengthens specific targets for the use of renewables in heating and cooling and in transport and sets such targets for the first time for the industry sector.
The directive defines today as the date by which EU countries are required to adopt new targets and measures to support the uptake of renewables across various sectors of the economy. These refer specifically to
  * **Heating and cooling:** a strengthened renewables targets requiring binding average annual increases
  * **Industry:** an indicative target of a 1.6% annual increase in renewable energy use and a binding target of 42% renewable hydrogen by 2030
  * **Transport:** Choice for EU countries to adopt either a target of a 14.5% greenhouse gas intensity reduction or a 29% share of renewable energy in final energy consumption, including sub-targets for advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin


In addition to these, the directive requires specific national rules to **strengthen energy system integration** with a view to supporting the faster electrification of end-uses and encourage the uptake of waste heat. EU countries also have to adopt an **enhanced and strengthened bioenergy framework** , with sustainability criteria aiming at a better protection of biodiversity and promoting the cascading use of biomass. 
The Commission has been supporting the transposition efforts of EU countries through the issuance of [guidance documents](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/renewable-energy/renewable-energy-directive-targets-and-rules/renewable-energy-directive_en#recommendations-and-guidance-notes), thematic sessions and bilateral meetings with all EU countries. Today’s requirements follow an earlier deadline of 1 July 2024 for provisions accelerating the permitting of renewables, the full implementation of which are decisive for the required increase in renewable energy generation.

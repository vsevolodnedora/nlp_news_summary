The 30 islands and island groups aiming to achieve complete energy independence by 2030 under the Commission’s “30 renewable islands for 2030” initiative have been confirmed today. Comprising islands from 10 different EU countries, the list varies from small islands such as Arranmore and Tory (Ireland) or the Giglio and Giannutri (Italy), which are just developing their energy transition plans, to already advanced islands like Tilos (Greece) or the Azores (Portugal), which are rather looking for support in the last mile of their energy transition. Under the initiative, these islands will decide on their own pathway to achieve climate-neutrality and then receive comprehensive assistance on how to achieve the different aspects of their transition.
Commissioner for Energy Kadri Simson said:
> 'I am delighted to see the completion of the next step in this initiative. The islands selected now have the opportunity to serve as pioneering models for planning and delivering clean energy systems, and how to manage these decentralised decarbonised electricity systems. This will provide invaluable insight for other islands, many of which are still highly dependent on expensive, imported fossil fuels. They can also serve as examples for the transition in towns and regions across the world.'

The call for 30 islands to participate in this initiative was launched by the European Commissioner for Energy Kadri Simson in June 2023 at this year’s EU islands forum on Saaremaa, Estonia. It received significant interest from islands across Europe. After careful consideration, the EU energy islands secretariat (in consultation with the Commission) has selected the 30 islands and island groups that will pioneer sustainable practices. They cover a broad variation in terms of geography, size, progress already achieved in the energy transition, and sectors to be transformed. Over the next three years, these islands will receive comprehensive assistance, catering for their specific energy transition needs, strengths and limitations and ensuring a successful transition to renewable energy-powered systems. The support scheme is designed to be "bottom-up," with the goal being for islands to decide on their own route to a carbon-free energy system and exchange best practices with the other islands.
### Background
One individual island may be small on the European scale. Yet there are some 2,400 inhabited islands in the EU with a total population of over 20 million inhabitants, which, if added up, would make it the sixth largest Member State of the EU. The ‘30 renewable islands by 2030’ initiative further delivers on the Commission commitment to support energy transition on the EU islands under the Clean energy for the EU islands initiative, launched in 2017.

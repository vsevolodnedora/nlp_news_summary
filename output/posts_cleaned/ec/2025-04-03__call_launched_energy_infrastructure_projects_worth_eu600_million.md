A new call for proposals for key cross-border EU energy infrastructure projects worth up to €600 million from the EU budget is being launched by the Commission today. Organised by the Climate, Infrastructure and Environment Executive Agency (CINEA), the call is open to projects included on the first [list of Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) and Projects of Mutual Interest (PMIs)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:L_202401041), adopted under the revised [TEN-E Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32022R0869&qid=1662501659291). The call, linked to the EU’s Connecting Europe Facility for Energy (CEF Energy), addresses funding proposals for studies and construction works and will be open until 16 September 2025 at 17.00 (CEST). Results will be known early next year. 
Commissioner for Energy and Housing, Dan Jørgensen said: 
> 'Now, more than ever, we must intensify our investments to ensure a genuine Energy Union. This is key to power our competitiveness, ensure our energy security and bring down energy costs for all. Constructing the crucial missing links for seamless cross-border energy flows is essential – and the Connecting Europe Facility’s contribution is instrumental in this respect.'
A CEF Energy online [info day will be organised on 22 May 2025](https://cinea.ec.europa.eu/news-events/events/cef-energy-virtual-info-day-2025-call-proposals-pcis-and-pmis-2025-05-22_en) to present the call, explain its policy context and inform about the application and evaluation process.
## Background
**Projects of Common Interest** (PCIs) are key cross-border infrastructure projects that link or significantly impact the energy systems of 2 or more EU countries. **Projects of Mutual Interest**(PMIs) link energy infrastructure of 1 or more EU country with neighbouring (non-EU) countries. By focussing on cross-border links, PCIs and PMIs are key to delivering on the EU’s energy and climate targets, safeguarding security of energy supply and improving market integration.
Projects selected as PCIs/PMIs can automatically benefit from many advantages stemming from the Trans-European Network for Energy (TEN-E) Regulation, including an accelerated permit granting and improved regulatory treatment. Project promoters are also eligible to apply for financial support for preparatory studies and/or construction works under [the CEF Energy programme](https://cinea.ec.europa.eu/programmes/connecting-europe-facility/energy-infrastructure-connecting-europe-facility-0_en). CEF Energy has a total budget of €5.88 billion for grants for the period 2021-2027.

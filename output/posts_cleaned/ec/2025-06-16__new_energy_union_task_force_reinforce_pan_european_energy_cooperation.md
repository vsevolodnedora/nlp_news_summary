In the margins of today’s Transport, Telecommunication and Energy Council, the European Commission and the Polish Presidency of the Council have launched the Energy Union Task Force. Comprising high-level representatives from the European Commission and Member States, the Task Force is aimed at fostering better cooperation and coordination on key energy policy issues. 
Outlined in the [Action Plan for Affordable Energy](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/strategy/affordable-energy_en) earlier this year, the Energy Union Task Force seeks to give political impulse to address key challenges that currently obstruct the development of a genuine Energy Union. Key priorities include optimising the use of energy infrastructure, accelerating interconnectivity, improving grid and energy system planning coordination among Member States, providing support in the monitoring of national action to implement the Action Plan, and discussing areas of mutual interests related to EU energy legislation implementation.
> _It is only by working even closer together that Europe will achieve a genuine Energy Union. This new Task Force will drive our work to deliver what our citizens and businesses are calling for: a secure, clean and affordable energy system_. _This is the backbone of an economy that prospers, and of a society that brings about benefits for all. –**Dan Jørgensen, Commissioner for Energy and Housing**_
It will receive support from relevant EU institutions and agencies, such as the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) as well as from other technical experts, when appropriate. Meetings will occur regularly, with a focus on formulating strategic deliverables which could take different forms subject to the concrete needs. A next meeting of the task force, planned for early September, will offer the platform to discuss first concrete policy items.
## Background
The Energy Union Task Force is a strategic initiative under the Action Plan for Affordable Energy. It is an informal arrangement without a legal mandate, which will not participate in formal processes of the European Commission or the Council. The Task Force will report regularly to the President of the European Commission, the European Council, the Energy Council, and the European Parliament.

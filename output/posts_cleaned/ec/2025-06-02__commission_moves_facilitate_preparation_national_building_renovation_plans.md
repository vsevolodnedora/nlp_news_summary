New tools to support EU countries and simplify the process of preparing their National Building Renovation Plans (NBRPs) have been published by the Commission today. The [documents](https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/8f5f9424-a7ef-4dbf-b914-1af1d12ff5d2/library/a8116057-2055-48e7-81c5-ee94a62de5c8) consist of an **annotated NBRP template** and a **spreadsheet template for NBRP data collection**. Under Article 3 of the [revised Energy Performance of Buildings Directive](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/energy-efficiency/energy-efficient-buildings/energy-performance-buildings-directive_en#revised-energy-performance-of-buildings-directive) (EPBD), EU countries are required to establish and submit the first draft of their NBRPs by the end of 2025.
Drafted in close collaboration with EU countries, the 2 templates are designed to simplify the planning process and ensure that all mandatory NBRP elements outlined in Annex II of the EPBD are addressed. While use of these tools is voluntary, they offer EU countries practical guidance to streamline the preparation of NBRPs.
NBRPs are a cornerstone for the[National Energy and Climate Plans (NECPs)](https://commission.europa.eu/energy-climate-change-environment/implementation-eu-countries/energy-and-climate-governance-and-reporting/national-energy-and-climate-plans_en). Effective EPBD implementation will also contribute to **lowering energy costs** and to **strengthening energy independence and resilience**. Since 52% of total EU natural gas consumption is directly or indirectly linked to buildings, NBRPs can also offer an important contribution to the objective of **ending Russian energy imports**.
## Background 
The [revised Energy Performance of Buildings Directive](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/energy-efficiency/energy-efficient-buildings/energy-performance-buildings-directive_en#revised-energy-performance-of-buildings-directive) (EPBD) sets out how the EU can achieve a fully decarbonised building stock by 2050 via a range of measures and thereby reduce energy bills for European citizens by structurally boosting the energy performance of buildings. It entered into force on 28 May 2024.
NBRPs will ensure the renovation of the national stock of residential and non-residential buildings, both public and private, into a highly energy-efficient and decarbonised building stock by 2050. The overarching objective is to transform existing buildings into a [zero-emission buildings](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/energy-efficiency/energy-efficient-buildings/nearly-zero-energy-and-zero-emission-buildings_en#zero-emission-buildings) stock. EU countries’ first draft NBRPs are due by 31 December 2025. These will be assessed by the Commission, followed by country-specific recommendations, if necessary. It will then be up to EU countries to update their plans to take into account the Commission assessment and submit the final version by 31 December 2026. The NBRPs are the evolution of the national long-term renovation strategies, first required in 2014.

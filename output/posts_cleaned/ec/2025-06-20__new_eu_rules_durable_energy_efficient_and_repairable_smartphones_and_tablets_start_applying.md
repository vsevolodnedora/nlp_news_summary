# New EU rules for durable, energy-efficient and repairable smartphones and tablets start applying
![We see a man and woman looking at a table that the man is holding. The text is: more durable, repairable and energy efficient phones and tablets in Europe](https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/styles/oe_theme_medium_no_crop/public/2025-06/top%20news_energy.jpg?itok=xA3zXIHh)
From today, **new EU ecodesign and energy labelling rules apply to smartphones, cordless phones and tablets** placed on the EU market. Designed to boost the product lifespan, energy efficiency, and ease of repair, the measures will also help consumers make **more informed and sustainable purchasing choices**.
The new rules will promote**sustainable consumption and savings** , and reduce the **environmental impact,** contributing to EU’s energy efficiency targets, cutting greenhouse gas emissions and promoting circular economy. With these rules, smartphones and tablets are expected to save **2.2 TWh** of electricity consumed by citizens while using these devices **by 2030** , which corresponds to one third
The new ecodesign and energy labelling requirements are set out in two key pieces of legislation for these types of products. 
The [Ecodesign Regulation lays out minimum requirements](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/1670/oj/eng) for mobile phones, cordless phones and tablets to be sold on the EU market to ensure
  * greater resistance to drops, scratches, dust and water
  * use of more durable batteries, capable of at least 800 charge cycles while retaining at least 80% of their initial capacity
  * clear rules on disassembly and repair, requiring manufacturers to supply key spare parts within 5-10 working days, and for at least 7 years after the product model is no longer sold in the EU
  * longer availability of operating system updates, at least 5 years from the date the last unit model is sold
  * fair access for professional repairers to the software or firmware needed for repairs


Under the [Energy Labelling Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/1669/oj/eng), smartphones and tablets must display information on energy efficiency, battery lifespan and resistance to dust, water and accidental drops. 
In addition, for the first time, products placed on the EU market will also need to **display a repairability score**. The score, from A (most repairable) to E (least repairable), appears on the label with other key details to help extend product lifespans for consumers.
The proposed energy label and accompanying product information will be made available through the [publicly available EPREL database](https://eprel.ec.europa.eu/screen/home). The label itself, together with the product information sheet, will be easy to download, enabling users to make a fully informed purchasing decision.
### Commissioners’ quotes
**Teresa** **Ribera,** Executive Vice-President for Clean, Just and Competitive Transition said: “By empowering consumers with reliable information and ensuring devices are designed to last longer and be part of a circular economy, we are making sustainability the new standard, not just for our environment, but for Europe’s digital future”
**Stéphane** **Séjourné** , Executive Vice-President for Prosperity and Industrial Strategy said: “Smartphones today are powerful and indispensable tools, yet all too often they quickly become obsolescent waste. With the new EU rules, we are turning the tide. We are establishing common European requirements for how phones and tablets should be designed, for these to be sold throughout our Single Market. These will meet global benchmarks for sustainability, foster innovation within European industry, and deliver to consumers devices that are built to last.”
**Dan Jørgensen** , Commissioner for Energy and Housing said: "We all spend so much time on our smartphones and tablets every day. More energy efficient and easy-to-repair devices will bring concrete benefits both to our citizens and to the environment. By being able to use their devices for longer, people can save money while also making a sustainable choice for the planet."
### Background
The [Circular Economy Action Plan 2020](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/strategy/circular-economy-action-plan_en)
Ecodesign and Energy Labelling policies support consumers, businesses, and governments in the clean energy transition. These policies address factors like energy consumption, water use, emissions and material efficiency. They also create business opportunities, strengthen market resilience, and drive demand for sustainable products, while reducing costs for end users. In 2020 alone, consumers saved over €63 billion in 2020 thanks to these policies.
The Commission adopted the new Ecodesign and Energy Labelling Regulations for smartphones and tablets in July 2023, after extensive consultation with industry, consumer groups, and environmental stakeholders. These rules exclude tablets, products with flexible main displays, and smartphones for high-security communication.

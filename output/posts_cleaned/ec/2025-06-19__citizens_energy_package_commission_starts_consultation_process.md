An [open public consultation and a call for evidence](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14737-Citizens-energy-package-protecting-and-empowering-consumers-in-the-just-transition_en) on the upcoming Citizens Energy Package have been launched by the Commission. This is an important step in the preparation of this initiative, intended to accelerate the transition towards cleaner energy sources, while ensuring a just transition in which all citizens are able to be actively involved and fully protected. The 12-week consultations are aimed at a broad range of stakeholders, including consumer organizations, regulators, industry representatives, local and regional administrations, and especially individual citizens. Taking account of the input from these exercises, the Commission is intending to table a Communication for the Citizens Energy Package towards the end of 2025. 
In broad terms, the Citizens Energy Package is intended to make the Just Transition a reality, addressing energy poverty and supporting the decarbonisation of coal regions in transition. It will further boost consumersâ€™ ability to take part in energy efficiency efforts and enjoy the benefits. Furthermore, it will ensure a solid framework for the empowerment and protection of energy consumers, both as individuals and as communities. It will identify ways to simplify rules, enhance awareness, and deliver technical and financial assistance. 
The Citizens Energy Package follows on from recently adopted EU key initiatives, notably the [Clean Industrial Deal](https://commission.europa.eu/topics/eu-competitiveness/clean-industrial-deal_en), and builds on the [Affordable Energy Action Plan](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/strategy/affordable-energy_en). It supports flexible market participation that benefits all consumers, with a strong link to the EU's electrification and [digitalisation strategies](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/eus-energy-system/digitalisation-energy-system_en), ensuring consumer-friendly delivery of services.
As well as the open public consultation and the call for evidence, the Commission is holding targeted consultations through the Citizens Energy Forum, Regulatory Round Table, and dedicated working groups on consumer issues and energy poverty.
This consultation will remain active for 12 weeks and will close on 11 September 2025.

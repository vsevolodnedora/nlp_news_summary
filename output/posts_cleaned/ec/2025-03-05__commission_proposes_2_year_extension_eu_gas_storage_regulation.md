The European Commission proposed[prolong the current Gas Storage Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52025PC0099&qid=1750954213781) (COM/2025/99) until the end of 2027. In the current geopolitical context and volatile situation in the global gas markets, this 2 year extension will contribute to ensuring continued security of energy supply across the EU and stability of the European gas market. It will notably ensure that the EU prepares for the upcoming winter seasons in a coordinated manner.
Commissioner for Energy and Housing Dan Jørgensen said:
> 'Gas storage has shielded EU citizens from the risk of supply disruptions and this is why it is crucial that we continue with this tool. However, Member States need sufficient flexibility to fill the storage throughout the summer under the best conditions. We are recommending this flexibility today to avoid market distortions in the current situation and reduce the stress in the market.'
The Gas Storage Regulation was adopted in June 2022, at the height of the energy crisis, to ensure sufficient supplies to power EU homes and businesses throughout winter. A [report on the functioning of the Gas Storage Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52025DC0098&qid=1750954284777) (COM/2025/98), also adopted today, highlights that it has ensured security of supply, lowering risks of supply disruption, allowing the EU to advance efforts to reduce energy dependence on Russia.
Since the 90% filling target was established, the EU has consistently exceeded it before the beginning of each heating season.
The EU’s significant [gas storage capacities and EU storage facilities](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/energy-security/gas-storage_en) are the main supply source of gas in winter, ensuring 30% of EU winter supply.
Today’s proposal is also accompanied by a [Commission recommendation](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/publications/recommendation-implementation-gas-storage-filling-targets-2025_en) (C/2025/1481) inviting EU countries to consider current market conditions and introduce flexibility when deciding on measures to refill storage facilities this summer, allowing them to fill their storage facilities throughout the season at optimal purchase conditions. This would help to avoid distortion of the internal energy market or negative effects of energy security of other EU countries or the EU as a whole, under current market conditions. 
## Next steps
The proposal will now be discussed by the European Parliament and the Council. 
In addition, the Commission plans to review the EU's energy security framework, during which it may assess whether more permanent storage-related measures are necessary.
The Commission will also continue monitoring the security of gas supply of the EU with EU countries in the Gas Coordination Group, and coordinate any potential measures taken to ensure optimal storage refilling.

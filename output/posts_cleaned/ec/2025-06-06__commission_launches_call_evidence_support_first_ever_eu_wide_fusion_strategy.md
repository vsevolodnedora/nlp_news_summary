The European Commission has published a 4-week [Call for Evidence](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14717-EU-Fusion-Strategy-_en) to collect feedback and provide input for the EU’s first-ever Fusion Strategy. Programmed for publication by the end of 2025, the strategy will be a key step to position the EU at the world forefront of fusion development and accelerate commercial fusion energy in the EU. This initiative delivers on commitments made in the [Clean Industrial Deal](https://commission.europa.eu/topics/eu-competitiveness/clean-industrial-deal_en) and the [Affordable Energy Action Plan](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/strategy/affordable-energy_en#affordable-energy-action-plan), and builds on recommendations from the [Draghi Report on European Competitiveness.](https://commission.europa.eu/topics/eu-competitiveness/draghi-report_en) Fusion is a promising low-carbon energy source that aims to replicate the process powering the stars by fusing light nuclei (e.g., deuterium-tritium). The EU remains a global leader in fusion through its central role in the ITER project and sustained efforts under the Euratom Research and Training Programme. However, global competition is growing, and countries such as the U.S., UK, China, and Japan, have already launched national fusion strategies and attracted growing levels of private investment.
To maintain the EU’s leadership and competitiveness in fusion, the strategy will 
  * outline actions to leverage Europe’s leading role in the ITER project and R&D
  * define a clear pathway to a pilot Fusion Power Plant
  * create a competitive industrial ecosystem
  * enhance private sector involvement (including startups) through public-private partnerships and new funding mechanisms
  * develop a workforce strategy to address skills shortage
  * mobilise and develop the European fusion supply chain
  * establish an enabling regulatory framework for fusion facilities
  * strengthen international collaboration
  * establish effective governance and decision-making process at EU level. 


Through this Call for Evidence, the Commission invites research stakeholders, industry and startups as well as private investors to provide inputs to shape the strategy and identify the most effective actions to support fusion development and deployment. Available in all 24 official EU languages, the Call for Evidence is open until 1 July 2025.

# Winners of first EU-wide renewable hydrogen auction sign grant agreements, paving the way for new European production
Six renewable hydrogen projects have signed their respective grant agreements, advancing them towards implementation.

[On 30 April 2024](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_24_2333)
Today, six out of those seven projects have signed their respective grant agreements. The awarded funding will help successful bidders to bridge the difference between their production costs and the price that industrial users are willing to pay for this emerging product.
This auction is one of the pillars of the [European Hydrogen Bank (EHB)](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/energy-systems-integration/hydrogen/european-hydrogen-bank_en)
The selected projects are located in four European countries:
  * Spain (Hysencia and Catalina);
  * Portugal (Grey2green II and MP2X);
  * Finland (eNRG Lahti);
  * and Norway (Skiga).


The Innovation Fund will support these projects with a fixed premium payment per kilogram of certified and verified renewable hydrogen produced. This means that no payments will be made before projects start production. From the time of the grant agreement signature, the projects have up to **five years to start producing renewable hydrogen**.
The total amount of support comes to EUR 694 521 237 and will be disbursed over a timespan of ten years. The individual grants range from EUR 8 million to EUR 245 million for installations with a megawatt electric (MWe) capacity from 35 to 500 MWe.
Renewable hydrogen produced will serve many sectors, such as maritime, heavy duty transport, agriculture, or in the production of e-methane and e-methanol.
Altogether, the projects have the **potential to produce up to 1.52 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen during the first ten years of their operations, avoiding more than 10 million tonnes of CO 2 emissions.**

One project out of the seven that were selected to receive support from the Innovation Fund pilot auction decided to withdraw from the grant agreement process.
Drawing from the experience of this pilot auction, the Commission plans to launch the second renewable hydrogen auction via the Innovation Fund by the end of 2024, with an increased budget of EUR 1.2 billion.

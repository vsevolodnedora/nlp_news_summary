The[ European Sustainable Energy Week (EUSEW)](https://sustainable-energy-week.ec.europa.eu/index_en) returns for its 19th edition. The EU is facing an important time for its competitiveness, clean energy goals, and security. It’s clear that action is needed. In line with the Clean Industrial Deal, fast tracking the rollout of renewable energy and energy efficiency will be a key way to help European industries grow and gain competitiveness. Another big focus will be on dealing with high and volatile energy prices that affect both businesses and people. This is why the overall theme of EUSEW 2025 is **‘Powering a fair and competitive green transition’**.
EUSEW takes place from **10 to 12 June 2025** in Brussels and online. Last year’s hybrid edition attracted over 12 000 participants from 127 countries with more than 2 000 delegates attending onsite. Save your place by [registering](https://interactive.eusew.eu/register) and pencil-in your sessions!
The [programme](https://interactive.eusew.eu/eusew-2025/programme/) comprises of 7 high-level plenaries (including the opening and closing sessions, keynote speeches and the traditional awards ceremony), 60 policy sessions, the European Youth Energy Day, as well as networking opportunities both online and onsite at the Energy Fair. 
The conference will engage hundreds of leading clean energy community voices in lively debates between each other and with the audience, exploring 5 main themes: competitiveness and investments in clean energy, energy affordability, renewables, energy efficiency, as well as decarbonisation and international cooperation. It will start on Tuesday morning, with EU Commissioner for Energy and Housing Dan Jørgensen opening the conference, joined by high-level representatives from EU countries and industry. 
EUSEW 2025 will also introduce the next cohort of 30 Young Energy Ambassadors (between 18 and 35 years old). They come from various EU countries, backgrounds and professions, but have in common that they are passionate about building a sustainable, secure, clean and fair energy future for Europe and the world.

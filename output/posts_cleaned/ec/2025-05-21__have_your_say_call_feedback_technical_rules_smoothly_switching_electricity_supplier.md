# Have Your Say: Call for feedback on technical rules for smoothly switching electricity supplier

The European Commission has launched a 4-week [public call for feedback](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13937-Access-to-data-for-switching-electricity-supplier-requirements_en) on a draft set of technical rules designed to make switching electricity suppliers faster, simpler, and more transparent across the EU. The draft rules introduce a common EU “reference model” for the interoperable and smooth exchange of secure data. This will also enable the technical process of supplier switching - involving registering a new supplier at a metering point with the market operator, all to be completed within 24 hours - already by the end of 2026. Shorter switching times increase transparency, empower consumers to make timely and informed choices, and enhance retail competition by enabling energy suppliers with advantageous, competitive offers to attract customers more easily. This will reduce administrative burdens, strengthen consumer choice, enable the faster take-up of competitive offers, and support the development of a digitalised retail energy market. The consultation is open until 17 June 2025.
In parallel, the European Data Protection Supervisor is being consulted on the implications of these technical rules for data protection and individuals’ rights with regard to the processing of personal data. Feedback will help refine the proposal ahead of discussions with the Electricity Cross-Border Committee and Member States’ experts.
## **Background**
This draft Commission Implementing Regulation relates to Article 24(2) of the [Electricity Market Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2019.158.01.0125.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2019:158:TOC) (EU) 2019/944, which empowers the Commission to adopt implementing acts on interoperability requirements and non-discriminatory, transparent procedures for data access. The proposed rules specifically address the data needed for final customers to switch electricity suppliers, as set out in Article 23(1) of the directive. This initiative introduces common EU-wide rules for data exchange based on a technology-neutral reference model, comprising a role model (outlining responsibilities and interactions), an information model (specifying data objects and attributes), and a process model (detailing procedural steps).
The draft was developed with input from key stakeholders, and with the advice of the Joint Working Group led by ENTSO-E and EU DSO Entity.
This initiative also aligns with the objectives of the upcoming Citizens’ Energy Package, reinforcing the EU’s commitment to a competitive, consumer-focused, and digitalised internal energy market.

# Energy label for low-temperature emitting radiators: Call for evidence launched 
The Commission has published a [call for evidence](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13998-Energy-labelling-of-low-temperature-heat-emitters_en) on a new energy label for low temperature emitting radiators. Such radiators are designed to minimise energy consumption while ensuring optimal heating. This 4-week call is part of the preparation for a possible delegated regulation to develop such an energy label, with the intention of finalising these rules by the end of 2026.
Radiators are key to the efficiency of heat pumps used for space heating of buildings. The balance between a building’s heat needs and its radiators’ heat output determines the temperature of the water flow in the system. This influences the efficiency of a heat pump supplying the heating water. 
Low-temperature emitters are designed to supply more heat from the same size radiator at low water temperature, in general because they incorporate forced convection. This makes heat pumps much more efficient, typically reducing their energy consumption by half (or even more) if all old radiators are replaced with new ones of equivalent size. Using them with condensing gas boilers brings further clear efficiency gains (5 % or more), while hybrid heat pumps also bring intermediate gains (between 5 % and 50% depending on the heat pump / boiler relative size). 
The low temperature emitter energy label will be aimed at displaying the information necessary to allow consumers to compare different low-temperature emitters and to enable installers to propose appropriate low-temperature emitters to their clients.
Stakeholders are invited to submit their feedback by 29 July 2025. The replies will feed into the Commission’s analysis, with the next step in the process being the preparation of an impact assessment. 
Feedback will be published on the Commission website in line with its [feedback rules](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/rules-feedback-and-suggestions_en).

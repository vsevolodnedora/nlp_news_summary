# Commission welcomes Council agreement on revision of Euratom Safeguards Regulation
The Commission welcomes today’s agreement in Council of revised rules on reporting by users of nuclear material in the EU within the framework of the ‘Euratom safeguards’ supervisory system. Based on the [proposal](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2023%3A793%3AFIN&qid=1703154599218) tabled by the Commission last December, the agreement consists of **a new Euratom Safeguards Regulation to update and replace the current**[**Regulation 302/2005**](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02005R0302-20130701), to take into account different developments in recent years in the nuclear sector and in information technology. The aim is to ensure the continued effectiveness and efficiency of Euratom safeguards in guaranteeing the peaceful use of civil nuclear materials in the EU.
Following today’s political agreement, the text will now be verified by lawyer linguists. As foreseen by the Euratom Treaty, the text approved by the Council will need to be officially adopted by the Commission. Once this happens, it will be published in the Official journal, and will enter into force 20 days later.
## Background
The [Euratom Treaty](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/EN/legal-content/summary/treaty-on-the-european-atomic-energy-community-euratom.html), laying the foundation for the peaceful use of nuclear materials and technologies in EU countries, establishes a nuclear material supervision system, known as ‘Euratom safeguards’.
These measures are currently provided by [Commission Regulation (Euratom) 302/2005](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02005R0302-20130701) of 8 February 2005. It lays down the obligations for the users of nuclear materials, such as declaring specific information to the Commission and keeping operation records. This enables the Commission to verify that nuclear materials are not diverted from their intended uses.

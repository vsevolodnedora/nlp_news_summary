The [Smart Readiness Indicator](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/energy-efficiency/energy-performance-buildings/smart-readiness-indicator_en) (SRI), introduced under the [Energy Performance of Buildings Directive](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/energy-efficiency/energy-performance-buildings/energy-performance-buildings-directive_en) (EPBD), measures a building’s ability to use smart technologies based on 3 key functionalities: optimising energy efficiency and overall in-use performance, adapting their operation to the needs of the occupant, and responding to signals from the grid, such as enabling energy flexibility. Over the past years, the SRI has been progressively tested across several EU countries, providing valuable insights into its implementation and potential benefits.
This month, Italy officially launched its SRI test phase, becoming the latest EU country to trial the scheme. Led by the Ministry of Environment and Energy Security and supported by ENEA (National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development), this 12-month pilot aims to refine the SRI framework for the national context.
Italy’s test phase will focus on assessing the state-of-the-art smart technologies available on the market, adapting the SRI service catalogue, and exploring potential integration with Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs). It will also analyse the correlation between SRI scores and EPC classes. The assessments will be conducted by ENEA experts, academic institutions such as the University of Cassino and Lazio Meridionale, members of Italian standardization bodies, and external trained assessors, covering at least 30 buildings across different use cases and climatic zones.
The SRI rollout continues to gain momentum across Europe, with 16 EU countries now having launched national test phases. In parallel, EU-funded projects such as SMART2, EasySRI, SRI2MARKET, and SRI-ENACT have been conducting complementary actions - at times directly supporting national test phases - such as refining assessment tools, standardising methodologies, and training evaluators. Early findings indicate that the SRI can help building owners assess and prioritise smart technologies that enhance building performance, while also fostering synergies between digitalisation and energy efficiency goals.
Under the recast Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, the European Commission must submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council by June 2026 on the testing and implementation of the SRI. The report will take into account the available results of the national test phases as well as the relevant projects.
For those interested in the latest SRI developments, the [3rd SRI Joint Event](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/events/smart-readiness-indicator-3rd-joint-event-2025-05-07_en) will take place on 7 May 2025 in Brussels and online. Organised by DG ENER, CINEA, and the LIFE project SRI-ENACT, the event will feature updates from SRI Platform Working Groups, insights from Member States and industry stakeholders, and findings from the SRI-ENACT project. Participants will have the opportunity to engage in interactive discussions on the future of smart-ready buildings in Europe.

**Background**
PCIs are key infrastructure projects aiming at completing the European internal energy market and help the EU to achieve its energy and climate objectives: delivering affordable, secure, and sustainable energy for all Europeans while pursuing a climate-neutral economy by 2050. PMIs are key cross-border energy infrastructure projects between the EU and non-EU countries, which contribute to the energy and climate policy objectives of the Union.
Energy infrastructure is a key enabler for the energy transition as reflected in the Commission’s communication on the [European Green Deal](https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en)
Projects selected as PCIs and PMIs can automatically benefit from many advantages stemming from the TEN-E Regulation, including an accelerated permit granting and improved regulatory treatment. Projects on the list can apply for financial support under [the CEF Energy programme](https://cinea.ec.europa.eu/programmes/connecting-europe-facility/energy-infrastructure-connecting-europe-facility-0_en)
CEF Energy has a grant budget of EUR 5.84 billion for the period 2021-2027.

A new mid-term matching round to coordinate joint gas purchasing, through the [AggregateEU mechanism](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/energy-security/eu-energy-platform_en#aggregateeu), will be launched by the Commission on 12 March 2025. The second of its kind, it will enable European and Energy Community buyers to express their demand for a 5 year period covering July 2025 until October 2030 and access competitive offers from reliable international suppliers. This mid-term matching round reinforces the Commission’s continued commitment to the phase-out of Russian gas supplies to the EU.
Buyers and sellers who wish to participate have until 10 March to register on the PRISMA platform and subscribe to AggregateEU. Buyers will then submit their demand between 12 and 17 March. From 18 to 21 March, this demand will be put out for expression of interest by potential suppliers. Matching results will be published by the Commission on 26 March. After the demand and supply are matched through the platform, companies are free to negotiate potential contracts bilaterally.
In previous matching rounds, buyers and sellers could indicate a preferred terminal in the EU for the delivery of liquified natural gas (LNG). To better reflect LNG trade practices and attract additional international suppliers, buyers and sellers can also indicate their preference to have the LNG delivered free-on-board.
## Background
Since 2023, joint gas purchases coordinated through the AggregateEU platform have been key to diversifying Europe’s gas supplies and reinforcing our energy security. 
The second mid-term matching round builds on a hugely successful first round. The first mid-term round took place from 15 to 27 February 2024. The demand submission phase closed on 21 February with 34 bcm of total demand submitted by 19 companies, including industrial players. The tender attracted offers for a total volume of 97.4 bcm from international suppliers, almost triple the demand submitted by EU companies.

The Commission has today launched 4 calls for evidence on the energy labelling and ecodesign requirements for both household refrigerators/freezers and refrigerating appliances with a direct sales function. This exercise marks the first step in reviewing the existing rules to take account of technological improvements since they were previously set. In line with the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR), they also look at whether the rules can be extended to include issues such as the lifetime sustainability of the products (including raw materials), durability, reliability, repairability, and recyclability. Aimed at manufacturers, stakeholders and private individuals, these calls will run until 22 June. 
Once the input from these calls have been evaluated, the Commission will launch a public consultation later this year. The broad aim is to finalise the new rules in 2026.

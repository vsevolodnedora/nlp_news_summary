EU-Moldova energy relations are set to get a boost this week as Commissioner for Energy and Housing Dan Jørgensen is visiting the EU candidate country to discuss cooperation on energy security and independence, affordability and the clean transition.
The EU continued to support Moldova to remain resilient and well-connected to the European energy networks while Russia was weaponising its energy supplies.
Tomorrow, Commissioner Jørgensen will co-chair the sixth meeting of the High-Level Energy Dialogue between the EU and the Republic of Moldova alongside Minister of Energy, Dorin Junghietu. A joint press point is foreseen at the end of the meeting, at around 13:15 CEST, which you can follow live on [EBS+](https://audiovisual.ec.europa.eu/en/ebs/live/2).
The Commissioner will also hold a bilateral meeting with the Prime Minister, Dorin Recean. Furthermore, he will visit a residential unit in Micăuți and a rural enterprise in Bardar Village that are being supported by the EU to renovate, become more energy efficient, and competitive.

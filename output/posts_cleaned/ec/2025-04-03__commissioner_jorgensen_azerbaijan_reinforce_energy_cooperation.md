Commissioner for Energy and Housing, Dan Jørgensen, will be in Baku tomorrow to reaffirm the [strategic energy partnership between the EU and Azerbaijan](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/international-cooperation/key-partner-countries-and-regions/neighbourhood-east_en#azerbaijan).
He will participate in the 11th Ministerial Meeting of the Southern Gas Corridor Advisory Council and the 3rd Ministerial Meeting of the Green Energy Advisory Council.
Commissioner Jørgensen will speak at the inaugural Southern Gas Corridor session and attend the Ministerial session, alongside representatives from partner governments, institutions and companies. The meeting will be a key opportunity to discuss the capacity expansion of the Southern Gas Corridor. The pipeline represents a crucial route of gas supply diversification for the EU and its neighbouring countries, as we seek to fully phase out Russian supplies.
Cooperation in the field of renewable energy and methane emissions abatement will also feature prominently in Commissioner Jørgensen's visit to Azerbaijan. The Green Energy Advisory Council will discuss efforts in the areas of energy efficiency and renewable energy development across the region. The Commissioner will also join a meeting with Azerbaijani, Georgian, Romanian, Hungarian and Bulgarian Ministers to take stock of the green energy corridor agreement. He will also co-chair an EU-Azerbaijan business roundtable on offshore wind energy development in the Caspian Sea alongside the Azerbaijani Minister of Energy, Parviz Shahbazov. 
On his way to Baku, the Commissioner will stop in Ankara, Türkiye, today to meet with the Minister for Energy and Natural Resources, Alparslan Bayraktar.

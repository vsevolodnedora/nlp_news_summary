# Commission hosts key international energy and climate events in Brussels this week to boost global action
The European Commission will host the first of a series of [High-Level Energy Transition Dialogues](https://www.iea.org/events/cop30-iea-high-level-energy-transition-dialogue) on 11 June, co-organised by the COP30 Presidency and the International Energy Agency (IEA), in the run-up to the UN Climate Change Conference in Belem (Brazil) in November. COP30 will focus on the acceleration of the global transition away from fossil fuels and making progress on the [Global Pledges](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_6053) to triple renewable energy capacity and double energy efficiency improvements by 2030. It is a good moment to build momentum on these Global Pledges, which were first proposed by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at the Major Economies Forum in April 2023 and then collectively approved at COP28.
Executive Vice-President for a Clean, Just and Competitive Transition, Teresa Ribera, will kick off the event in Brussels with a keynote speech at around 13:40 CEST, together with COP30 President-Designate, Ambassador André Corrêa do Lago, and IEA Executive Director, Fatih Birol. Commissioner for Energy and Housing, Dan Jørgensen will represent Europe in a roundtable discussion with other global energy and climate decision-makers at around 15:00 CEST. The [opening of the High-Level Energy Transition Dialogue](https://audiovisual.ec.europa.eu/en/ebs/1/20250611) will be broadcasted on the Commission's audiovisual portal. 
On 12-13 June, Executive Vice-President Ribera and Commissioner Jørgensen will participate in the [10th Annual Global Conference on Energy Efficiency](https://www.iea.org/events/10th-annual-global-conference-on-energy-efficiency), co-organised by the Commission and the IEA in Brussels. They will engage with key partners to drive energy efficiency progress and the related Global Pledge forward. Energy efficiency is critical to bring about the secure, affordable clean energy system that will help us meet our climate and competitiveness goals. The conference will be [live streamed](https://www.iea.org/events/10th-annual-global-conference-on-energy-efficiency#watchSessions).

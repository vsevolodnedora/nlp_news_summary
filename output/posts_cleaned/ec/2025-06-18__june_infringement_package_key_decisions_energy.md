In its regular package of infringement decisions, the European Commission pursues legal action against Member States for failing to comply with their obligations under EU law. These decisions, covering various sectors and EU policy areas, aim to ensure the proper application of EU law for the benefit of citizens and businesses.
In the list of June infringements, there are 2 energy-related letters of formal notice and 2 reasoned opinions.
## Letters of formal notice
**Commission calls PORTUGAL and ROMANIA to comply with the EU rules on ecodesign and energy labelling of products**  
The European Commission decided to send letters of formal notice to **Portugal** (INFR(2025)2073) and **Romania** (INFR(2025)2074) for not ensuring effective compliance with the EU regulations on ecodesign ([Directive 2009/125/EC](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2009/125/oj/eng)) and energy labelling ([Regulation (EU) 2017/1369](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2017/1369/oj/eng)) of products. Member States are responsible for ensuring effective surveillance of their markets and that only products complying with all the applicable EU rules are placed on the market. In practical terms, this means checking products satisfy the minimum energy use requirements and have a correct energy label providing consumers with the information they need for purchase decisions. The Market Surveillance Regulation ([Regulation (EU) 2019/1020](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/1020/oj/eng)) sets out the obligation of the Member States to ensure effective market surveillance, which include having a national market surveillance authority, resourcing it adequately and giving it power to investigate, performing checks on products at an adequate scale and reporting those checks in the Information and Communication System for Market Surveillance database. The Commission considers that the two Member States do not comply with this obligation and is therefore sending letters of formal notice to Portugal and Romania, which now have two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion.
## Reasoned opinions
**Commission urges GREECE and FINLAND to fully transpose EU rules accelerating permitting procedures for renewable energy projects**  
The European Commission decided to send a reasoned opinion to **Greece** (INFR(2024)0221) and **Finland** (INFR(2024)0226) for failing to fully transpose into national law the provisions of the revised Renewable Energy Directive related to the simplification and acceleration of permitting procedures. The revised Directive ([Directive (EU) 2023/2413](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2023/2413/oj/eng), amending [Directive (EU) 2018/2001](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2018.328.01.0082.01.ENG#:~:text=DIRECTIVE%20\(EU\)%202018/2001%20OF%20THE%20EUROPEAN%20PARLIAMENT%20AND%20OF%20THE) entered into force in November 2023 and certain provisions had to be transposed into national law by 1 July 2024. These provisions include measures to simplify and accelerate permitting procedures both for renewable energy projects and for the infrastructure projects which are necessary to integrate the additional capacity into the electricity system. They also include clear time limits for permit-granting procedures targeted to specific technologies or types of projects, the strengthening of the role of the single contact point for applications and the presumption that renewable energy projects and the related grid infrastructure are of overriding public interest. In September 2024, the Commission sent letters of formal notice to 26 Member States for failing to fully transpose the Directive into national law. After having examined the transposition measures notified by Greece and Finland, the Commission has concluded that neither of the two Member States have yet fully transposed the provisions related to the simplification and acceleration of permitting procedures. The Commission is therefore sending a reasoned opinion to both Member States, which now have two months to respond and take the necessary measures to complete the transposition. Otherwise, the Commission may decide to refer the cases to the Court of Justice of the European Union.

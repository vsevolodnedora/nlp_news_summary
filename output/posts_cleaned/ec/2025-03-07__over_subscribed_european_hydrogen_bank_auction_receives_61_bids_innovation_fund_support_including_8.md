The [_European Hydrogen Bank_](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/energy-systems-integration/hydrogen/european-hydrogen-bank_en)**61 bids from projects in 11 countries** within the European Economic Area (EEA). Eight of the bids were submitted under the dedicated maritime topic by hydrogen producers with off-takers in the maritime sector. 
The**more than €4.8 billion** , four times the available budget of €1.2 billion provided by the [ _Innovation Fund._](https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/eu-funding-climate-action/innovation-fund_en)**around 6.3 Gigawatts (GWe)**. Over ten years, these projects would produce more than 7.3 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen. On a yearly basis, this would cover 7% of the EU’s REPowerEU ambition for domestic renewable hydrogen production in 2030. 
> **Wopke Hoekstra** , Commissioner for Climate, Net Zero and Clean Growth, said: _“The amount of bids in this second auction under the European Hydrogen Bank again shows the attractiveness of the Innovation Fund as a tool for Europe’s industrial decarbonisation and competitiveness. This continued appetite from our industry reinforces the development of a European market for clean hydrogen. As a key driver of our goal to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, hydrogen plays a crucial role in cutting emissions from hard-to-abate sectors. It will strengthen Europe’s industrial leadership in emerging clean technologies, ensuring long-term economic resilience and global competitiveness.”_

**Next Steps**
The [ _European Climate, Infrastructure and Environment Executive Agency (CINEA)_](https://cinea.ec.europa.eu/programmes/innovation-fund_en)**evaluation results by the end of May 2025** and successful applicants will be invited to prepare and sign corresponding Grant Agreements. 
The Grant Agreements are expected to be **signed by November 2025 at the latest**. The selected projects will have to reach financial close within 2.5 years and start producing renewable hydrogen within five years of signing the grant agreement. They will receive the awarded fixed premium subsidy for up to 10 years upon certified and verified renewable hydrogen production. 
In parallel to finalising the evaluation, the Commission will draw on the lessons learned from this second auction to prepare the Terms & Conditions for a**third auction for hydrogen, which it aims to launch before the end of 2025**. 
**Background**
With an estimated revenue of €40 billion from the [_EU Emissions Trading System_](https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/eu-emissions-trading-system-eu-ets_en)
The European Hydrogen Bank is an initiative to facilitate the EU's domestic production and imports of renewable hydrogen. It aims to unlock private investment in the EU and in third countries by addressing investment challenges, closing the funding gap, and connecting future renewable hydrogen supply to consumers, helping to meet the objective of 20 million tonnes of hydrogen in the EU energy mix by 2030. It will also allow the Commission to collect reliable data about the EU's renewable hydrogen project pipeline, the level of competition for this kind of support, the costs of renewable hydrogen production and its market price.

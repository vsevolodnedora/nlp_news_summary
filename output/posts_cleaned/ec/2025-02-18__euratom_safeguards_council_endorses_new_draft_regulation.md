# Euratom safeguards: Council endorses new draft regulation
The Commission welcomes today’s agreement in Council to approve the draft EU regulation updating the application of [Euratom safeguards](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/nuclear-energy/euratom-safeguards_en), the nuclear material supervision system established under the Euratom Treaty. This paves the way for the Commission’s formal adoption of the new rules in all EU languages in the coming weeks and its subsequent publication in the Official Journal. The new Safeguards Regulation will enter into force 20 days after the publication, replacing the previous [Regulation (Euratom) 302/2005](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02005R0302-20130701), which is repealed.
Based on the [proposal](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2023%3A793%3AFIN&qid=1703154599218) tabled by the Commission in December 2023, the main changes are linked to taking into account different developments in recent years in the nuclear sector and in information technology. The aim is to ensure the continued effectiveness and efficiency of Euratom safeguards in guaranteeing the peaceful use of civil nuclear materials in the EU.

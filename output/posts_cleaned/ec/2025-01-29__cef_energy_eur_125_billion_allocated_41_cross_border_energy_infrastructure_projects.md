The major results of this CEF Energy call show the reinforced commitment of both the industry and the EU to achieve an integrated EU energy market and the EU's decarbonisation objectives,” said Director of CINEA, Paloma Aba-Garrote.
The 41 selected projects cover both works (5) and studies (36) in the fields of electricity, hydrogen and CO2 infrastructure.
The formal adoption of the decision by the European Commission on the selection of proposals and award of grants for action will follow in the coming weeks. Then CINEA will start preparing the grant agreements with the beneficiaries.

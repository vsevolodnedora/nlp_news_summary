# In focus: Europe’s road to fusion energy

Fusion is the energy source of the sun and other stars, and has the potential to provide clean, cost-efficient, and safe energy to power Europe’s future, joining the already ongoing development of renewable energy sources. 
Fusion occurs when atoms are pushed together under extremely high temperatures and pressure, causing them to release enormous amounts of energy by merging into heavier atoms. The EU, in collaboration with international partners, is working to reproduce the fusion process on Earth, making fusion energy a viable clean energy source in the coming decades. 
> 'As difficult as this technology is, its potential is huge. Nuclear fusion is safe. It is a clean source of energy. It would be an ideal complement to renewable energy in the energy mix in the future.'
> European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen 
## Fusion in Europe
Fusion science and technology have a long history in Europe, and their development was accelerated from 1957 by the signature of the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, or Euratom. This created a basis for European cooperation on fusion and accelerated research and development activities. Since then, Euratom has coordinated fusion research in Europe through funding to [Fusion for Energy](https://fusionforenergy.europa.eu/who-we-are/) (created in 2007) and [Eurofusion](https://euro-fusion.org/) (established in 2014). 
### ITER
Under construction in the south of France, [ITER](https://www.iter.org/) is a cutting-edge project under which the EU collaborates with 6 other parties to take fusion energy to the threshold of industrial exploitation. It is designed to prove the scientific and technical feasibility of fusion as a new energy source, and will conduct research and development activities aimed towards supporting the creation of the first demonstration fusion power plant - referred to as DEMO.
The ITER machine – a fusion reactor (or tokamak), is designed to produce fusion reaction in a hydrogen plasma confined by strong magnets. It will reach internal temperatures of 150 million degrees Celsius, which is 10 times the temperature of the sun’s core.

The EU is a key member of ITER, providing 45% of ITER’s funding. Between 2021-2027, the EU allocated €5.61 billion to the project in the Union’s budget. 
### EU strategy on fusion
In his [report on the future of European competitiveness](https://commission.europa.eu/topics/eu-competitiveness/draghi-report_en) (2024), Mario Draghi calls for an EU strategy on fusion and the creation of a public-private partnership to promote its quick commercialisation. This is due to fusion being a disruptive technology that holds the potential to revolutionise the energy landscape in the second half of this century. This recommendation is echoed in the [Action Plan for Affordable Energy](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/strategy/affordable-energy_en#affordable-energy-action-plan) which states that to support fusion as an innovative, decarbonised energy source for the future, a Fusion Strategy will be proposed, including the creation of a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) to accelerate commercialisation.
## The Broader Approach
In 2007, the EU and Japan signed an agreement to cooperate on fusion research and development, called ‘[The Broader Approach](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/research-and-technology/fusion-energy-and-iter/broader-approach_en)’. It has been a highly successful cooperation effort between 2 likeminded partners, both dedicated to driving research efforts to support ITER and make fusion energy a reality.
The agreement entails cooperation on 3 fusion-related projects, namely 
  * **The JT-60SA Reactor** – currently the largest operational tokamak in the world. It is designed to support the operation of ITER and help optimise the design and operation of future fusion energy power plants. 
  * **The International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility** – to prototype a facility aiming to test materials to verify if they can withstand the extreme conditions needed to produce fusion energy. 
  * **The International Fusion Research Centre** – covering several projects to support the work under ITER, such as computer intensive fusion simulations or the construction of a remote operation room where ITER operational data can be analysed in real-time. 


## EU at EXPO 2025
On 13 April 2025, the [World Expo in Osaka](https://eu-at-world-expos.europa.eu/index_en) opened its doors. Under the theme ‘Nurturing Tomorrow’, the EU pavilion focuses on Europe’s efforts to create a cleaner, fairer, and more prosperous future. 
EU-Japan cooperation under the Broader Approach agreement is featured in one of the exhibits at the EU Pavilion at the EXPO. Between 17-29 September, during the week on ‘The Future of Earth and Biodiversity’, the EU pavilion will organise the event 'Think today about the fusion energy of tomorrow', showcasing the EU-Japan privileged partnership in the field of fusion.

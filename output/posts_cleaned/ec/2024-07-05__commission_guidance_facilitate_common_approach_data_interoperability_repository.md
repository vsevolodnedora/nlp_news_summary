With EU rules foreseeing a new repository on electricity metering data interoperability next year, the Commission has today published a [**Guidance document**](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/f33b3dd9-3a82-11ef-a1cb-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-331204923) to enable EU countries to follow a consistent and comparable approach for reporting their respective national practices, which will be stored there. This approach aims to streamline the process and ensure uniformity. As part of the Commission’s [Digitalisation of Energy Action Plan](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/energy-systems-integration/digitalisation-energy-system_en#eu-action-plan-for-digitalising-energy), the repository will make it easier for electricity suppliers and innovative energy service companies to operate across the internal electricity market, and thereby promote competition in the retail market, while also avoiding excessive administrative costs. It will also foster innovation in energy services, particularly in energy efficiency and renewable energy, and is part of the Commission's commitment to a more consumer-centric, decarbonised, decentralised, and digitalised energy landscape. Today’s Guidance was foreseen under [Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1162](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2023/1162/oj), adopted last year to ensure the interoperability of national systems for market participants to access their customers’ electricity metering and consumption data. Under Article 10 of this regulation, EU countries are required to carry out and maintain an up-to-date mapping of their respective practices at national level.
Using the [**template in the Guidance**](https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/7736f95b-4eb3-4f8e-a0a3-0b62c3ed4f0b/library/13b4134c-aec7-44b7-a861-c8295972bbd9), EU countries will report on national implementation of the specific technical rules in a consistent and comparable way, and thereby enhance the usability of the repository where the information is stored. This will help improve transparency, trust, efficiency, and predictability in data exchanges, thereby lowering barriers for new market entrants. The rollout of interoperable data access in the retail energy market and the digitalisation of the energy sector means market players, such as energy service providers, will find it easier to successfully operate across Europe. It will thereby offer European customers a wider choice, attractive new offers, and more opportunities to participate in the energy transition. 
## Background
The development of this Guidance is a result of extensive collaboration and consultation with all stakeholders and the Joint Working Group (JWG) on Data Interoperability of the European bodies of network operators (ENTSO) for Electricity ([ENTSO-E](https://www.entsoe.eu/)) and the [DSO entity](https://eudsoentity.eu/). The process was guided by feedback received from EU countries during a series of 5 workshops on this topic, co-organised by the Commission and the JWG, and the draft guidance proposal by the JWG prepared in line with Article 12(a) of the Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1162. 
The new rules in the implementing regulation will come into effect on 5 January 2025, and EU countries must then report their national practices to the Commission by 5 July 2025.

**Leipzig, 14 January 2025** - In 2024, EEX Group further solidified its position as a global commodity exchange by achieving further overall growth across its various asset classes. 
Throughout the year, EEX Group continued to drive market development in collaboration with its customers and focused on the extension of its product portfolio across both established markets and new areas, such as the Guarantees of Origin sector. 
In addition, the Group also expanded its reach through the establishment of a new EEX subsidiary in Japan, where traded volumes of EEX Japan Power derivatives contracts have almost quadrupled year-on-year.
To underpin the Group’s commitment towards supporting the energy transition, it also spearheaded various collaboration initiatives in the environmental and hydrogen sectors, in addition to introducing new contracts with the potential to further drive renewables integration. 
Peter Reitz, CEO of EEX, comments: _“2024 has been another year of remarkable growth for our markets overall, primarily driven by our global power markets as well as our North American operations, along with reassuring stability on other markets. In 2025, we will continue to work closely with the trading communities to develop the markets, while also acting on our commitment to supporting the energy transition.”_

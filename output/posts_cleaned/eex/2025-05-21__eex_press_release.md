**Leipzig, Tokyo, 21 May 2025** - The European Energy Exchange (EEX) marks the fifth anniversary of the launch of its power trading platform on the Japanese power derivatives market. Since its inception in May 2020, the total volume traded on this market totalled 160 TWh, making it the fastest growing EEX power derivatives market and placing amongst the top ten EEX power markets in Q1 2025. In addition to the originally available trade registration services, EEX also launched central order book trading for Japanese power derivatives in April 2025.
Steffen Koehler, Chief Commercial Officer of EEX, comments:_“The exceptional expansion both in terms of volumes and participant numbers continues on our Japanese power derivatives market in its fifth year. It is exciting to see how a newly liberalised market can develop in such a short time and we are very much looking forward to driving this growth even further, together with the domestic and international trading community as well as the local regulators. We are convinced that our wide product portfolio and the recently introduced order book will provide even more trading and hedging opportunities for the trading community.”_
The dynamic growth of this market has continued this year as well, with record daily, weekly and monthly volumes reported in March 2025.
Today, EEX offers an extensive product portfolio for the Japanese power derivatives market, including base and peak futures from week to six-year maturities for the Tokyo and Kansai areas, in addition to day and weekend base and peak futures for the Tokyo area. Additionally, monthly options were introduced in February 2025.
Japan is the fourth largest power market in the world, with an annual consumption of around 900 TWh. According to Japanese Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies (ISEP), about 30% of the total electricity generated in the country during 2023 came from LNG.
EEX also offers several contracts for the wider LNG markets, including the TTF Natural Gas Month Futures denominated in US$/MMBtu, as well as the EEX JKM LNG Natural Gas Futures.

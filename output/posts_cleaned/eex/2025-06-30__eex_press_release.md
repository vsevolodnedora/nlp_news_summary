**Leipzig, 30 June 2025 -** On 27 June 2025, the European Energy Exchange (EEX) and the Taiwan Carbon Solution Exchange (TCX) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) at EEX headquarters in Leipzig, Germany. This agreement marks a significant milestone in the development of the Taiwanese Emissions Trading System (TW ETS) and highlights EEX’s role in supporting TCX’s capacity building by sharing its extensive operational experience with the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS).
Mr. Joshua Tien, CEO of TCX, noted that _“the EU ETS has been one of the world’s leading carbon pricing mechanisms since its launch in 2005, with EEX serving as a key infrastructure partner.”_ He emphasised that _“Taiwan is preparing for the pilot phase of its ETS in late 2026, in line with the roadmap by the Taiwanese Ministry of the Environment. Through this strategic partnership, TCX aims to leverage EEX’s best practices in market operation to support the establishment of TW ETS.”_
Peter Reitz, CEO of EEX, added: _“Emission Trading Systems worldwide are essential for our joint journey of decarbonisation and the wider energy transition. EEX has accumulated vast experience in developing and operating such schemes and we are always delighted to contribute our expertise for the development of new systems. We remain committed to the advancement of carbon pricing all around the globe.”_
The signing ceremony was witnessed by several distinguished guests, including Mr. Shieh Jhy-Wey (Representative of Taiwan in Germany); Mr. Peng Chi-Ming (Taiwan’s Minister of Environment (MOENV)); Ms. Wen-Chen Shih (Deputy Minister); Mr. Ken-Mu Chang (Deputy Director General), and Ms. Tse-Hua Hu (Director General, Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission).
Building upon EEX’s experience and proven expertise in operating the EU ETS, the MoU lays the foundation for international collaboration that will support TCX’s efforts to develop a robust and transparent carbon market. The EU ETS is already linked with the Swiss ETS and is currently exploring further linkage with the UK system. Beyond Germany, several of Taiwan’s regional neighbours, such as Japan and South Korea, have established or are developing ETS. The signing of this MoU not only marks the beginning of a cooperation between EEX and TCX but also sets the stage for potential international linkages between Taiwan and other carbon markets in the future – ultimately contributing to the achievement of its 2050 net-zero emissions goal.

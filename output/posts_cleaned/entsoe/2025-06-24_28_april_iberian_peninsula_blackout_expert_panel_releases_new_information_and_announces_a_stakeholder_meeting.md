#  news 28 April Iberian Peninsula Blackout: Expert Panel releases new information and announces a stakeholder meeting
24 June 2025
Following its third meeting on 23 June, the Expert Panel established to investigate the 28 April blackout in the Iberian Peninsula has made significant progress in analysing the power system conditions prior to the incident. 
The Panel can now provide information on the power system conditions in the hours and moments leading up to the blackout. Just after the initial generation trips, the voltage had reached values exceeding the operational limits in large parts of the Spanish transmission network, which ultimately led to the blackout. In order to present these most recent facts established by the Expert Panel, ENTSO-E has updated its dedicated [webpage](https://www.entsoe.eu/publications/blackout/28-april-2025-iberian-blackout/) which serves as an information portal for stakeholders throughout the investigation. An update on the Panel’s progress with data collection is also provided.
On 18 July, ACER and ENTSO-E will organise a dedicated workshop of the European Stakeholder Committee established in accordance with the relevant network codes and guidelines. During this workshop, the Expert Panel will engage with stakeholders, shed light on the facts confirmed so far based on the available data and explain the next steps of the investigation. More information about the European Stakeholder Committees can be found on the ENTSO-E website ([here](https://www.entsoe.eu/network_codes/esc/)).

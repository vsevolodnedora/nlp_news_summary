#  news Play a role in EU electricity cybersecurity: Join ACER's stakeholder committee
4 June 2025
ENTSO-E supports the effort by EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) to establish a new European Stakeholder Committee (ESC) on cybersecurity in the electricity sector. We encourage industry associations that could offer a pan-European perspective on cybersecurity aspects of cross-border electricity flows to join.
**What’s behind this?** [The Network Code for Cybersecurity](https://www.entsoe.eu/network_codes/nccs/) for Electricity came into force in June 2024. It sets out common rules to boost cyber resilience across Europe’s power systems. It calls for ACER to coordinate stakeholder engagement, in close collaboration with the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) and the EU Distribution System Operators Entity (EU DSO Entity).
**What will the cybersecurity committee do?**
Through this new ACER cybersecurity committee, industry associations will cooperate with each other and with the authorities referred to in the Cybersecurity Network Code to:
· Identify problems and propose improvements to the implementation of the existing cybersecurity network code;
· Recommend future revisions of the network code;
· Identify whether any additional risk prevention rules may be needed for the electricity sector; and
· Respond to technological developments in the sector.
By tackling these points, the cybersecurity committee will help maintain a high, common level of cyber resilience in Europe’s electricity grid and adapt policy to evolving digital risks.
**Who can join?** ENTSO-E encourages industry associations that could offer pan-European views on cybersecurity aspects of cross-border electricity flows to take part. It is a chance to bring your insights to the table and ensure the voice of industry shapes the future of electricity cybersecurity in Europe.

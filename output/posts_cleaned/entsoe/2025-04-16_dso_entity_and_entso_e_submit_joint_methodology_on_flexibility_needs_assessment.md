#  news DSO Entity and ENTSO-E submit joint Methodology on Flexibility Needs Assessment
16 April 2025
On 16 April 2025, [DSO Entity](https://eudsoentity.eu/) and [ENTSO-E](https://www.entsoe.eu/) jointly submitted to [ACER](https://www.acer.europa.eu/the-agency/about-acer) the proposal for the FNA Methodology that defines the type and format of data and the methodology for the analysis by transmission system operators and distribution system operators of flexibility needs at national level.
The FNA Methodology enables Member States to establish non-fossil flexibility targets that can potentially lead to the implementation of support schemes for non-fossil flexibility when required. The FNA Methodology, jointly developed by DSO Entity and ENTSO-E, is a pioneering tool that contributes to fostering system flexibility amidst the rapid growth of renewable energy sources, while also addressing increasing network flexibility needs.
Various stakeholder engagement activities, including webinars and [](https://www.entsoe.eu/news/2025/04/16/dso-entity-and-entso-e-submit-joint-methodology-on-flexibility-needs-assessment/)[a public consultation](https://www.entsoe.eu/news/2025/04/16/dso-entity-and-entso-e-submit-joint-methodology-on-flexibility-needs-assessment/) , were hosted alongside the drafting process to get feedback and comments from different groups of stakeholders. The two associations’ response to the public consultation feedback, received between 8 November and 6 December 2024, is available at [this link](https://consultations.entsoe.eu/system-development/public-consultation-on-flexibility-needs-assessmen/supporting_documents/PC_consolidated_simplified_RESPONSES.xlsx) .
The full proposal will also be presented during a joint public webinar, scheduled on 24 April from 14:00 to 15:30 (CEST). Registration to this public webinar can be done [here](https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/233a5000-47aa-41d1-9a83-51f1927d8e02@7ffbeccf-0c1b-496c-8978-89209c2d375d).
**_Background information_**
In accordance with Article 19 of the (EU) 2019/943, which entered into force with the (EU) 2024/1747 Electricity Market Design Reform (EMDR), DSO Entity and ENTSO-E have been entrusted to define the data type, the data format, and the methodology for the analysis of the flexibility needs (FNA Methodology) that electricity distribution system operators (DSOs) and transmission system operators (TSOs) are to provide at national level to the regulatory authority, or designated authority or entity.
**_Next steps_**
Within three months of receipt of the proposal, ACER will either approve the proposed Methodology or amend it. In case of amendments, ACER will consult the Electricity Coordination Group, DSO Entity and ENTSO-E before adopting the amendments. The adopted proposal will be published on ACER’s website. DSO Entity and ENTSO-E will continue to collaborate with ACER during this period.

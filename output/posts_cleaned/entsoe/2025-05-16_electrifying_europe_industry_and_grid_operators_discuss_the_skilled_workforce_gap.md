#  news Electrifying Europe: Industry and Grid Operators discuss the Skilled Workforce Gap
16 May 2025
Brussels, 16 May 2025 – Yesterday’s joint public webinar, “Electrifying Europe: Perspectives from the Industry and Grid Operators on Skilled Workforce as a Supply Chain Bottleneck,” brought together high-level voices from across Europe’s energy ecosystem to address one of the most pressing challenges in the energy transition: the growing shortage of skilled workers.
Jointly hosted by ENTSO-E, T&D Europe, DSO Entity and Europacable, the event highlighted the growing recognition of workforce development as a key enabler in accelerating the deployment of critical energy infrastructure—from renewables and storage to grid modernisation and cybersecurity.
In his opening remarks, Branislav Pilat (ENTSO-E) emphasised the urgency: “The energy transition will stall without the people to deliver it. This is no longer a future risk—it’s a current roadblock.”
The European Commission, represented by Ilija Jovančević (DG ENER), reaffirmed the EU’s commitment to building a “Union of Skills,” calling for coordinated investment in education, re-skilling, and labor mobility to support the energy system of tomorrow.
Concrete examples from operators and manufacturers showcased promising initiatives.
Participants agreed that scaling such initiatives requires long-term policy support, stable investment, and greater collaboration between public and private sectors.
Furthermore, this sentiment was supported by the stakeholders. More than 150 stakeholders attended the two-hour session, engaging in a lively Q&A and proposing next steps to address the workforce challenge at EU and national levels. 96% of the participants highlighted that skilled workforce shortage is already affecting the progress and slowing down the future targets for energy transition. 71% of the participants agreed that national governments, European institutions, industry and grid operators and academia should work together to solve the workforce challenge.
Next Steps:
ENTSO-E, T&D Europe, DSO Entity and Europacable will share the outcome at Energy Infrastructure Forum (Copenhagen Forum) 2025 and continue knowledge sharing on this key topic for the whole electricity ecosystem.

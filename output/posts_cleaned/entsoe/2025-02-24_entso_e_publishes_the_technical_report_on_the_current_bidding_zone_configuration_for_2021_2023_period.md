On 24 February ENTSO-E publishes the Technical Report on the current bidding zone configuration for the 2021‒2023 period. The ENTSO-E Bidding Zone Configuration Technical Report provides transparent and factual information for the status on congestions across the European Union, on flows scheduled outside the market, the costs of these congestions and includes the Clean Energy Package´s 70% minimum capacity assessment. The report is an important input to the assessment of the efficiency of the current bidding zone configuration performed by ACER. An adequate bidding zone configuration is an important factor for efficient congestion management and well-functioning markets.

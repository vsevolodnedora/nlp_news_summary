ENTSO-E Releases Position Paper on Cost-Sharing for Offshore Energy Projects
28 July 2025
The Electricity Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2019/943 recast) requires ENTSO-E to carry out the European Resource Adequacy Assessment (ERAA). The ERAA methodology, adopted by ACER in 2020, sets the standards for performing the ERAA and serves as the foundation for National Resource Adequacy Assessments (NRAAs).
In response to the 2021-2022 energy crisis, the Electricity Market Design Reform (EMDR) introduced key updates to the Electricity Regulation and Directive in July 2024. These updates recognize capacity mechanisms (CMs) as structural elements of the European electricity market and called for a review of the regulatory framework surrounding resource adequacy.
Following this, the European Commission published a report in March 2025 assessing how to simplify the CM application process. The report also addressed concerns regarding the complexity of the current ERAA methodology. Consequently, ACER requested ENTSO-E to update and streamline the ERAA methodology to enhance robustness, ease implementation, and incorporate lessons learned.
ENTSO-E is now proposing several amendments to the ERAA methodology based on these insights and invites all stakeholders to review the draft proposals and share their feedback via the public consultation [here](https://www.entsoe.eu/eraa/methodology-revision/?utm_source=ENTSO-E+Member+Brief&utm_campaign=b9ee7e3256-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2024_04_05_01_10_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_-2411c18a3d-).

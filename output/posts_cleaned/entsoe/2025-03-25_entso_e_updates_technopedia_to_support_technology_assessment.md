#  news ENTSO-E updates Technopedia to support technology assessment
25 March 2025
ENTSO-E has updated its Technopedia, providing insights on emerging technologies for Europeâ€™s electricity grid. As the energy transition accelerates, staying ahead of technological developments is crucial to ensuring a reliable and efficient power system.
The Technopedia offers a collection of factsheets, each assessing how advanced a technology is in the European context using a Technology Readiness Level (TRL), helping to understand which innovations are ready for implementation and which are still in development.
By providing a clear overview of technology progress, Technopedia supports knowledge sharing and inform decision-making as TSOs plan for the future.
Later this year, ENTSO-E and the EU DSO entity will expand this initiative with the DSO-TSO Technopedia, a separate platform focusing on technologies relevant to both Transmission and Distribution System Operators. This will strengthen collaboration across the electricity sector and ensure a coordinated approach to innovation.

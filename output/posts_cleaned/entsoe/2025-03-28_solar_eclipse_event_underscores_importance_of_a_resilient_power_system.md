#  news Solar Eclipse Event Underscores Importance of a Resilient Power System
28 March 2025
**_This Saturday, a partial solar eclipse will offer Europeans a rare spectacular sight. Thanks to their coordinated action, ENTSO-E and Europe’s Transmission System Operators (TSOs) have implemented proactive measures to maintain power consumption as the eclipse unfolds. This event offers us a reminder of the importance of Europe’s interconnected electricity network._**
On 29 March, the partial solar eclipse will briefly darken the skies over Europe, leading to a temporary dip in solar power generation in many countries. In Brussels, the eclipse will peak at 12:07 PM local time, with the Moon covering nearly a quarter of the Sun’s surface.
Thanks to their existing coordination channels and procedures, TSOs have taken action to ensure grid stability throughout the event. Furthermore, coordination with Distribution System Operators (DSOs) has been ensured to maintain safe operations at all levels of the power system.
**How does ENTSO-E ensure a resilient power system?**
ENTSO-E has activated a special team to oversee preparations and responses before, during, and after the eclipse. Interconnection capacity plays a vital role in these preparations, allowing electrical power systems to support each other during situations that could pose risks to supply security. These measures are not just for this event — they are also applied in other situations where significant fluctuations might occur.
**What impact will the eclipse have on solar power generation?**
As a key energy source, solar power [accounted](https://www.solarpowereurope.org/) for 9,2% of EU Electricity generated in 2023. The eclipse is expected to temporarily reduce solar power generation by up to 21 GW across Central Europe, depending on weather conditions — enough to power millions of homes. Most countries will experience a noticeable decline, such as Germany, while Spain will face the largest drop.
**What proactive measures have TSOs taken to maintain stability?**
To maintain power consumption during the eclipse, TSOs across Europe are taking coordinated measures to balance supply and demand. Additional backup power, including fast-acting frequency reserves, is ready if needed. Experts will monitor power levels in real-time and make adjustments as necessary. Planned maintenance work on power lines have been postponed. Control room staff have undergone additional training to handle any unexpected scenarios. 
To further support these efforts, ENTSO-E is assisting its members in setting up monitoring tools and conducting weekly assessments of the situation. 
Events like this remind us of the importance of a resilient energy network as Europe continues its transition to a more renewable future. With the right measures in place, this solar eclipse is not a challenge but an opportunity to demonstrate how well prepared we are for the future of energy.
_About ENTSO-E_
ENTSO-E, the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity, is the association for the cooperation of the European transmission system operators (TSOs). The 40 member TSOs, representing 36 countries, are responsible for the secure and coordinated operation of Europe’s electricity system, the largest interconnected electrical grid in the world. In addition to its core, historical role in technical cooperation, ENTSO-E is also the common voice of TSOs.

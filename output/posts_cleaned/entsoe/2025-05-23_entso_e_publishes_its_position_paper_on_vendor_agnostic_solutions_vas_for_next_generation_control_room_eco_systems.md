#  news ENTSO-E publishes its position paper on “Vendor Agnostic Solutions (VAS) for Next-Generation Control Room Eco-Systems
23 May 2025
ENTSO-E has released a new Position Paper on Vendor Agnostic Solutions (VAS) for Next-Generation Control Room Eco-Systems, outlining the vision for modular, interoperable control centre eco-systems that address the growing complexity of European power systems and the limitations of legacy SCADA/EMS infrastructures.
Driven by the RDIC WG5 Task Force on VAS, this initiative brings together forward-thinking TSOs committed to evolving from the existing control centers tools, fragmented interfaces, and inflexible system architectures. The paper highlights that no single vendor can meet the growing needs of TSOs in the digital age, especially as grid operations increasingly rely on real-time data, automation, and cyber-resilience
TSOs have reached a pivotal point where existing supervisory control and data acquisition systems are no longer sufficient. The new modular eco-system aims to integrate legacy systems with future expansions across real-time, planning, and ex-post analysis domains
In line with Mission 4 of the ENTSO-E RDI Roadmap 2024–2034, the paper lays the foundation for redefining how control centres are designed and managed in the future. Ultimately, the position paper reflects a paradigm shift in how TSOs approach system operations, advocating for innovation, open architectures, and a collaborative path forward that ensures security, interoperability, and resilience across Europe’s energy landscape.

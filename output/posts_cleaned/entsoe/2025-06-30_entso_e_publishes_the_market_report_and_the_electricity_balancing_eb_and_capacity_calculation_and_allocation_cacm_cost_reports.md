ENTSO-E publishes today the ENTSO-E Market Report 2025 and Electricity Balancing (EB) and Capacity Calculation and Allocation Cost Reports.
These publications outline the work achieved by European Transmission System Operators (TSOs) in cooperation with their stakeholders in integrating the European electricity wholesale and balancing markets by implementing the Capacity Allocation and Congestion Management (CACM) Regulation, the Forward Capacity Allocation (FCA) Regulation and the Electricity Balancing (EB) Regulation.

The CACM cost report includes costs of establishing, updating or further developing and operating the price coupling algorithm and single day-ahead coupling, the continuous trading matching algorithm and single intraday coupling,
The EB Cost Report includes the costs of establishing, amending and operating the European balancing energy platforms for the exchange of balancing energy from frequency restoration reserves and replacement reserves and for the imbalance netting process.

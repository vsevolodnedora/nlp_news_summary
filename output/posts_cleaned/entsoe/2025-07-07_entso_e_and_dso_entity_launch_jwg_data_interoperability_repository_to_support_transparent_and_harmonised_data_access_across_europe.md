#  news ENTSO-E and DSO Entity launch JWG Data Interoperability Repository to support transparent and harmonised data access across Europe
7 July 2025
ENTSO-E and DSO Entity are pleased to announce the launch of the **Joint Working Group (JWG) Data Interoperability Repository** , a new digital platform developed in line with the **European Commissionâ€™s Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1162.**
This initiative marks a key milestone in the implementation of the EUâ€™s data interoperability framework and supports the broader goals of the energy transition.
As Europe moves toward a more decentralised, digital, and decarbonised electricity system, data interoperability has become a cornerstone for ensuring efficiency, transparency, and consumer empowerment. The JWG Data Interoperability Repository provides a central access point for stakeholders to explore how Member States are implementing the EU reference model for data access, as well as to access key resources and updates developed by the JWG.
The platform features:
  * A **repository of national practices** , collecting reports submitted by Member States on the implementation of interoperability requirements and procedures for access to metering and consumption data
  * **Reference models** and technical documentation developed by the JWG, including role, information, and process models
  * **Outputs from Task Force 3** , which supports the development of harmonised data models and alignment with standardisation efforts


The repository is now publicly accessible and will be continuously updated as new national mappings are submitted and as the JWG advances its work. It is designed to support all actors in the energy sectorâ€”consumers, aggregators, service providers, and system operators, by enabling secure, simple, and non-discriminatory access to electricity data.
This launch reflects the joint commitment of ENTSO-E and DSO Entity to foster a harmonised and interoperable data environment that empowers innovation, enhances grid efficiency, and supports the development of a truly integrated European energy market.
**Background information:**
The JWG on Data Interoperability was established in June 2023 by ENTSO-E and DSO Entity to perform the tasks foreseen in Articles 11, 12, and 13 of the [Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1162](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2023/1162/oj/eng). These include supporting the European Commission in developing guidance for Member States, collecting and publishing national reports, and monitoring the implementation of the [Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1162](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2023/1162/oj/eng) and future implementing acts on data interoperability adopted by the European Commission.

23 June 2025
ENTSO-E’s biennial Ten-Year Network Development Plan (TYNDP) is the pan-European electricity infrastructure plan that identifies opportunities for reinforcing the electricity grid and assesses infrastructure projects.
A total of 179 transmission infrastructure projects, consisting of 353 separate investments, and 50 storage projects were proposed by project promoters during the first submission window of the TYNDP 2026 project collection which took place from 24 April to 26 May 2025. For comparison, the previous TYNDP 2024 cycle assessed 177 transmission and 33 storage projects.
The list of submitted projects is published **[here](https://eepublicdownloads.blob.core.windows.net/public-cdn-container/tyndp-documents/TYNDP2026/List_of_all_submitted_projects_For_Publication.xlsx)** along with basic project information. Please note that this is a preliminary list and does not represent the definitive set of projects to be included in the TYNDP 2026.
ENTSO-E is currently reviewing all submitted projects against the administrative and technical criteria set in the _[TYNDP 2026 Guidance for Applicants](https://eepublicdownloads.blob.core.windows.net/public-cdn-container/tyndp-documents/TYNDP2026/250331_TYNDP2026_GuidanceforApplicants-For_Publication.pdf)_ and assess their eligibility. Once the review is completed, project promoters will be informed of the eligibility of their projects and the lists of accepted and rejected projects will be published on ENTSO-E’s website in October 2025.
Projects deemed compliant will be formally included in the TYNDP 2026 Project Portfolio. ENTSO-E will perform a cost-benefit analysis of these projects, which will then be able to apply to the European Commission list of Projects of Common Interest / Project of Mutual Interest.
A second submission window is **foreseen in Q3 2025.** This window is designed to allow more time for the development of projects currently still in ideation phase. Thus, only projects in a non-mature phase of development will be considered. Interested project promoters may refer to the Guidance for Applicants and can write to **_tyndp@entsoe.eu_** for more information.

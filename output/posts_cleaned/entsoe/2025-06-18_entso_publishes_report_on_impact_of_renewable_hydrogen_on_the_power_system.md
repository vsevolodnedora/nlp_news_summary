#  news ENTSO Publishes Report on Impact of Renewable Hydrogen on the Power System
18 June 2025
The development of the hydrogen sector, especially the electrification of hydrogen production, will significantly impact the power system, both in terms of planning and operation.
Previous ENTSO-E studies have identified the technical capabilities of electrolysers to provide grid system services, along with key challenges related to their system and market integration. Building on these findings, and considering the uncertain evolution of the hydrogen economy and evolving market dynamics, the new report “Impact of Renewable Hydrogen on the Power System: Sector Development, Flexibility and Market Aspects” further explores the integration of hydrogen into power systems and electricity markets.
As part of a broader assessment of short- and long-duration flexibility sources, this study focuses on renewable hydrogen with particular attention to the role of electrolysers in the power system and their flexibility potential. The report analyses the operational modes of electrolysers, examines enabling market and regulatory frameworks, and explores how electrolysers could contribute to a more flexible and power system-aware hydrogen production landscape.

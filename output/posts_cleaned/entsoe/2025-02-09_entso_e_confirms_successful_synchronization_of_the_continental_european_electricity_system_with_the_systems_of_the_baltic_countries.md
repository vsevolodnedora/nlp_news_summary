#  news ENTSO-E confirms successful synchronization of the Continental European electricity system with the systems of the Baltic countries
9 February 2025
**ENTSO-E announces the successful synchronization of the electricity systems of the Baltic states with the electricity system of Continental Europe. This historic event is a key milestone for the Baltic States and for Europe strengthening the energy resilience and independence across the region. This achievement underlines the substantial and leading role of ENTSO-E in facilitating European cooperation and enhancing the stability of the interconnected power system.**
Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have successfully synchronized their electricity grids with the Continental Europe Synchronous Area (CESA) on 09 February 2025 at 14:05 EET, marking a historic milestone in their journey towards strengthened energy system resilience and integration with the Continental Europe electricity grid.

This synchronization enables the Baltic States to manage their electricity grids in close cooperation with all other Continental European countries, with stable and reliable frequency control, significantly enhancing regional energy security. Previously relying on the Russian and Belarussian systems for frequency management, the Baltic states have now joined the synchronous grid of Continental Europe, serving over 400 million customers. All electricity interconnections with Russia and Belarus have been permanently disconnected.
This process follows years of thorough preparation and cooperation among the Baltic transmission system operators (TSOs): Elering (Estonia), Augstsprieguma tīkls (AST, Latvia), Litgrid (Lithuania), and their counterparts in the Continental Europe synchronous area. A particularly important role of PSE in Poland was the overall coordination and project management, as a direct neighbour and as the system which physically connects the Baltic States’ systems to Continental Europe. Extensive infrastructure upgrades in the Baltic states and Poland were essential for this achievement. Amprion as Continental European Coordination Centre North supported the planning and coordination of synchronization.
Zbyněk Boldiš, ENTSO-E President:
> The synchronization of the Baltic states with the Continental Europe Synchronous Area is an important step towards strengthening the energy independence and security of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. It also underlines the power of European solidarity and cooperation in building a resilient and interconnected energy future.”
Dan Jørgensen, Commissioner for Energy and Housing:
> It is great to see that Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are now fully independent and disconnected from the grids of Russia and Belarus. The full integration of the Baltics in the EU internal energy market and the synchronisation of their electricity networks with Continental Europe –ahead of schedule– is a landmark event for the entire EU. With over EUR 1.2 billion invested under Connecting Europe Facility, the Baltic synchronisation is a clear testing point of the power of our collective investments. This flagship investment will strengthen the security of supply and energy independence of the entire EU. We will keep working towards a stronger, genuine Energy Union in the EU, where clean, secure and affordable energy drives our competitiveness.”
This synchronization has been strongly supported by the European Union and ENTSO-E, the association of European electricity transmission system operators. Their contributions have included technical guidance, operational and legal expertise, and European funding to facilitate the successful integration.

#  news Incident in the power systems of Spain and Portugal
28 April 2025
On 28 April 2025 soon after 12h30 CET, a major incident occurred in the power systems of Spain and Portugal.  
  
The incident resulted in a black-out in the power system of both countries. Some areas close to the border of France with Spain were also affected by the incident, albeit for a very limited duration.  
  
The utmost priority is the restoration of the power system. The established procedures and protocols for restoring the voltage of the electricity system have been activated immediately. Power system restoration is currently ongoing and some regions of the Iberian Peninsula have already been energized thanks, among others, to the support of the power system resources such as hydro-power plants and the existing interconnections with France and Morocco.  
  
The TSOs of Spain and Portugal are providing continuous information of the restoration process.

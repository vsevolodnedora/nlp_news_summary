# German energy companies say 2030 wind power targets cannot be achieved without Chinese hardware 
## 
WirtschaftsWoche
Despite warnings of potential security risks posed by Chinese components in wind turbines, major energy companies oppose a ban in Germany, arguing that the country's planned expansion path cannot be achieved without them, business weekly WirtschaftsWoche [reported](https://www.wiwo.de/politik/deutschland/sicherheitsbedenken-energiekonzerne-gegen-verbot-chinesischer-bauteile-in-windanlagen/30249932.html). The companies [EnBW](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/enbw) and [RWE](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/rwe-ag), which operate large onshore and [offshore wind](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_o#offshore_wind) farms, argue that without the involvement of Chinese manufacturers, wind expansion targets for 2030 will be virtually impossible to achieve. They warn that supply bottlenecks and cost advantages speak in favour of incorporating Chinese technology in German wind farms.
In a recent [advisory paper](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/military-experts-warn-security-risks-through-planned-chinese-wind-turbines-german-coast), the German Institute for Defence and Strategic Studies (GIDS) said a planned wind farm off the German coast should be prevented due to security concerns over Chinese-made hardware used in the turbines. Hamburg-based Luxcara is aiming to use turbines entirely made by Chinese turbine manufacturer Mingyang for the plant. Germany is aiming to install at least [30 gigawatts (GW)](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/german-offshore-wind-power-output-business-and-perspectives) of offshore and [115 GW](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/german-onshore-wind-power-output-business-and-perspectives) of [onshore wind](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_o#onshore_wind) power capacity by 2030. "This expansion requires a strong supply chain," an [EnBW](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/enbw) spokesperson told WirtschaftsWoche. "Currently, there is a very limited number of suppliers." While [EnBW](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/enbw) does not currently operate any Chinese wind turbines, it may do so in the future. "In order to keep up with global competition, we don't want to completely rule out the theoretical possibility of considering Chinese manufacturers, because ultimately, it's also a matter of economic considerations."
[RWE](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/rwe-ag) is also considering Chinese manufacturers for future installations. The company stresses that security policy aspects must be clarified by policymakers. "In view of the limited production capacities in offshore supply chains worldwide, from the company's point of view there would be no fundamental objection to Chinese manufacturers producing on a level playing field, in Europe and according to our high European standards,‚Äù an [RWE](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/rwe-ag) spokesperson explained.
The GIDS study warned that Chinese technology installed at strategic offshore locations could be used to monitor the movements naval vessels and aircraft and outlined other potential risks. The Chinese Chamber of Commerce to the EU (CCCEU) has rejected the claims, describing them as implausible and completely unfounded.

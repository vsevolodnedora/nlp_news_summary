Bids for Germany’s latest solar photovoltaics ([PV](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_p#pv)) support tender exceeded the auctioned total capacity by more than twice, said the Federal Network Agency ([BNetzA](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/federal-network-agency-electricity-gas-telecommunications-post-and-railway-0)) in [a press release](https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/SharedDocs/Pressemitteilungen/DE/2025/20250210_FFAV.html?nn=659670). Projects with a total capacity of almost five gigawatts (GW) were submitted to be awarded the right to build solar farms and receive support, and the agency awarded 242 projects with a total capacity of 2.15 GW. 
The “high level of competition” means that the need for subsidies for new ground-mounted systems continues to fall, said [BNetzA](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/federal-network-agency-electricity-gas-telecommunications-post-and-railway-0) president Klaus Müller. The average bid value was 4.76 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) of electricity, around six percent below the value of the previous round (5.05 ct/kWh). The last time such low values were achieved was in 2019, said the agency.
For years, Germany has used auctions to determine support for renewable electricity to help the buildout of technologies like wind and solar electricity. The system is meant to bring down costs for renewables support, as projects offering production with the lowest need for support win the auctions.
Germany has made solar [PV](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_p#pv) a key technology in its efforts to decarbonise the country’s energy supply. The total capacity of all installed solar power systems [surpassed 100 GW](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/german-solar-capacity-breaches-100-gigawatts-industry-association) at the turn of the year, and Germany aims to more than double this figure to 215 GW by 2030.

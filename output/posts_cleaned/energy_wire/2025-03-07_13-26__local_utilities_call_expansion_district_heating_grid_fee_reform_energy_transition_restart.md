# Local utilities call for expansion of district heating, grid fee reform for energy transition “restart”
## 
Clean Energy Wire
Germany should restart its transition away from fossil fuel-based energy with a larger focus on cost-efficiency, [said](https://www.vku.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/vku-fordert-neustart-fuer-die-energiewende-und-stellt-handlungsvorschlaege-zur-diskussion/) local utility association [VKU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/vku-german-association-local-utilities). Among [the proposals](https://www.vku.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Verbandsseite/Positionen/Kommunale_Energieversorgung/250307_VKU-PosPa_Handlungsempfehlungen_Neustart_Energiewende_final.pdf) for the country’s next government are a reform of electricity [grid fees](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_g#grid_fees), using CO2 price revenues to lower [distribution grid](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_d#distribution_grid) fees, and decrease the electricity tax to the EU minimum. District heating should be expanded, for which existing regulations needed to be updated.
[VKU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/vku-german-association-local-utilities) also called for lowering the [offshore wind](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_o#offshore_wind) power expansion target ([70 gigawatt (GW) by 2045](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/germanys-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-climate-targets)) to 45-50 GW, because a high concentration of wind parks in the North Sea would mean that the turbines rob each other of wind yield. It also said that [carbon capture and storage](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_c#carbon_capture_and_storage) ([CCS](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_c#ccs)) should be allowed for gas power plants – even if this was not going to make economic sense for all units across Germany.
Germany’s next government [will have to tackle many climate and energy challenges](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/key-climate-and-energy-matters-germanys-next-government) – some of them it will inherit from the outgoing government, while others become more urgent as the country's 2030 targets come into sight. These include providing adequate back-up capacity for the growing share of renewable power, and providing industry with more clarity on [CCS](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_c#ccs), while keeping especially energy-intensive industry competitive.

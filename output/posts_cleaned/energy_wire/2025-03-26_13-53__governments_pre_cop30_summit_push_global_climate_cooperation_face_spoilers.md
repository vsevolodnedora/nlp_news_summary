# Governments at pre-COP30 summit push for global climate cooperation in face of “spoilers”

Representatives of around 40 governments have used a climate conference in Germany to call for multilateral cooperation in combatting climate change, even as some countries are stepping on the brakes in an increasingly difficult geopolitical environment.
“We all see how tremendously difficult the geopolitical situation is,” said EU climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra. “Multilateralism is under attack, the rule of law is under attack, and we are facing problems from all directions – clearly also in the domain of climate action.” If the global community is able to strengthen multilateralism, “at COP30 we will send a very strong signal that the transition to a net-zero economy is not only possible, but actually already fully on the way,” he added.
Governments met in Germany’s capital Berlin for two days of climate talks – [the Petersberg Climate Dialogue](https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/aussenpolitik/themen/klimaenergie/petersberg-climate-dialogue-2707198) – to lay the groundwork for the UN climate conference COP30 at the end of the year in Brazil. Global climate efforts are currently overshadowed by the new US administration’s decision to leave the [Paris Climate Agreement](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_p#paris_climate_agreement) and pull back from national and international efforts to help prevent the worst consequences of human-made climate change.
In the current challenging geopolitical times, the world had more “spoilers,” who aimed to prevent the climate transition, said German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock. Thus, it was all the more important to emphasise and make the most of its economic benefits. “If others like the US remain on the outside, it is their decision,” said Baerbock. “We are making it clear that we now want to jointly utilise the opportunities for companies in Europe, but also for cooperation with companies and countries in Latin America, Africa and other regions of the world,” she said.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz said he regretted the US decision to leave the [Paris Agreement](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_p#paris_agreement). “It is clear that denying and ignoring the facts does not make the consequences of climate change disappear, nor the responsibility of the USA as historically the largest emitter of [greenhouse gases](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_g#greenhouse_gases),” said Scholz. However, by halting climate efforts, the country would lose the chance to use economic opportunities, as the global market for climate-friendly climate technologies continued to grow rapidly.
Brazilian diplomat André Aranha Corrêa do Lago, president of the climate conference in Brazil in November, said that the challenging geopolitical environment spurred cooperation among governments present in Berlin. “There is a clear feeling that we need to strengthen multilateralism, that there is no alternative,” he said.

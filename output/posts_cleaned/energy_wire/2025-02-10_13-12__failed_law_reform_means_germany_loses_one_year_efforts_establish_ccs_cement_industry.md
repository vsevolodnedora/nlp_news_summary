# Failed law reform means Germany loses one year in efforts to establish CCS – cement industry

Parties’ failure to agree on final details of a reform to allow [carbon capture and storage](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_c#carbon_capture_and_storage) ([CCS](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_c#ccs)) in Germany ahead of the election on 23 February will set efforts back significantly, industry representatives [tol](https://www.wiwo.de/unternehmen/industrie/co2-speicherung-wir-verlieren-ein-gutes-jahr/30199020.html)[d](https://www.wiwo.de/unternehmen/industrie/co2-speicherung-wir-verlieren-ein-gutes-jahr/30199020.html) business magazine Wirtschaftswoche. “We will probably lose a good year in building a CO2 infrastructure,” said Martin Schneider, managing director of cement industry association [VDZ](https://www.vdz-online.de/en/).
The outgoing coalition government [had prepared](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/germany-open-door-onshore-co2-storage-federal-states) the reform of Germany’s carbon [storage](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_s#storage) law and introduced it in parliament in 2024. At the time, the Free Democrats ([FDP](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/fdp-free-democratic-party)) were still part of the coalition and insisted successfully that [CCS](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_c#ccs) should also be allowed for gas-fired power plants. [After the coalition break-up](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/carbon-capturing-plans-stall-amid-ongoing-talks-after-german-coalition-break), lawmakers from the remaining partners – the Social Democrats ([SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party)) and the Greens – no longer supported the reform, and instead intensified efforts in parliament discussions to rid the draft of this provision. This is why the reform has failed to garner a majority in parliament, despite support from the conservative opposition ([CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union)). The reform is not on the agenda for parliament’s [last session](https://www.bundestag.de/resource/blob/473452/2276c3e16e600acd952c9eb3280aeab9/Tagesordnung-komplett.pdf) in this legislative period on 11 February. It would have to be re-introduced in parliament in the next legislative period. 
Long-term [storage](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_s#storage) of CO2 is currently forbidden in Germany, and capture and transport face significant regulatory hurdles. Years of protest against industry [plans to use CCS](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/quest-climate-neutrality-puts-ccs-back-table-germany) as a lifeline for coal power have made the technology a no-go issue for many politicians in Germany, Europe and beyond. Yet, countries' goals of climate neutrality around mid-century reopened debate on the issue of combatting CO2 emissions that are difficult to avoid, for example in cement production. The German government [has proposed plans to make CCS possible](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/qa-germanys-draft-carbon-management-strategy) to help the country reach [greenhouse gas](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_g#greenhouse_gas) neutrality by 2045. State support would focus on capturing and storing or using carbon from industrial processes where emissions are difficult or impossible to avoid.

As the European Union’s focus shifts [away from climate action](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/eu-under-pressure-weaken-more-climate-policies-denmark-says-2024-12-17/) and towards increasing security and competitiveness, the question whether it will set a [90 percent emissions reduction target for 2040](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/qa-eu-propose-2040-emissions-reduction-target) has become central. 
_*** Our weekly Dispatches provide an overview of the most relevant recent and upcoming developments for the shift to _climate neutrality i _n selected European countries, from _policy and diplomacy to society and industry.___ For a _bird's-eye view of the country's climate-friendly transition_ , read the respective '[Guide to](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/guides)'. ***_
The target was expected to be announced alongside the [Clean Industrial Deal](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/german-industry-hails-eu-competitiveness-plan-ngos-warn-red-tape-cuts-threaten-climate-action) strategy, unveiled at the end of February. But when the time came, it was missing – an omission that was only revealed by the European Commission in a briefing the night before the industry strategy's release. In mid-March, the Commission [said](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/eu-delay-2040-climate-target-proposal-beyond-q1-commission-2025-03-21/) that the target proposal was being delayed to an unspecified future date and will not come out in the first quarter of 2025 as planned.
Senior policymakers from the EU and from member states have come out against the 90-percent target [recommended](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-90-percent-emission-cut-2040/) by the Commission last year and want the EU's executive branch to lower it or shelve it entirely. Italy’s energy minister, Gilberto Frattin, [told the Commission](https://strategicenergy.eu/minister-pichetto-fratin-and-teresa-ribera-discuss-the-future-of-renewable-energy-and-bioenergy/) on the sidelines of the Energy Council in Brussels in March that a proposal with this target level should not get published. In a note to the Commission, Frattin said that the EU “should carefully consider the recommended choice of the 90 percent reduction target for 2040, compared to alternatives of 80 percent and 85 percent, both compatible with the net zero goal by 2050," arguing that “the risk would be forcing countries into overly drastic measures with uncertain outcomes.”
The proposal would come in the form of an amendment to the EU’s climate law, which has already set a 55-percent reduction target for 2030 and the goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. The proposal would then need to be approved by majority vote in the Council of national governments and in the European Parliament. [Only eight](https://www.politico.eu/article/commission-pushes-eus-2040-climate-target-law-into-spring/) of the EU’s 27 countries have explicitly supported the 90-percent target. Commission president Ursula von der Leyen’s European People’s Party (EPP) – the largest group in the European Parliament – is split on the issue, with several senior EPP MEPs openly [criticising](https://www.endseurope.com/article/1911226/2040-climate-target-expected-delayed-commission-admits) the idea.
Dan Jørgensen, the new EU energy commissioner, insisted in a [public session with energy ministers](https://video.consilium.europa.eu/event/en/27861) in Brussels that the Commission is not backing away from the Green Deal legislation adopted during von der Leyen’s first term. “The EU’s fight against climate change does not stop just because a big country on the other side of the Atlantic withdraws from the [Paris Agreement](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_p#paris_agreement),” he said. But [climate campaigners](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/01/13/unions-green-groups-fear-sweeping-deregulation-as-eu-pursues-competitiveness-agenda) fear the overall direction is that the EU is retreating from the climate fight.

# Germany open to fossil gas and hydrogen cooperation with African countries
## 
Tagesspiegel Background / Clean Energy Wire
The German government is open to partnering with African countries on fossil gas projects, as well as blue hydrogen production (made from fossil gas, where carbon is captured and stored), [reports Tagesspiegel Background](https://background.tagesspiegel.de/energie-und-klima/briefing/rot-gruen-in-afrika-vorerst-auch-fuer-erdgasprojekte). New guidelines on cooperation with countries on the African continent emphasise work towards ending fossil fuel use and expanding renewables, but leave the door open to fossil gas and hydrogen derived from it.
“African raw materials and energy – in particular electricity from renewable energies as well as green and, temporarily, low-carbon hydrogen and its derivatives and, temporarily and under certain conditions, natural gas – are key factors for a successful energy transition in Africa, Europe and Germany,” the government's [Africa policy guidelines](https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/resource/blob/2693124/8e9088700f1746fce6404d2500a24300/afrikapolitische-leitlinien-data.pdf) say.
The government said that guidelines from 2019 had needed updating to reflect developments since then, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, Russia’s war on Ukraine and its effects on Africa, and climate change as a security issue. Focal points of German-African cooperation would be overcoming global challenges including climate change, economic cooperation, strengthening democratic resilience, education, and supporting security, peace and stability.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s government has sought to diversify gas imports and find new suppliers since the halt of direct supplies from Russia in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine. Scholz had said Germany could support countries [like Senegal](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/german-senegalese-gas-plans-under-fire-violating-pledge-end-fossil-fuel-support) in their efforts to extract and export gas, and pushed for including an exception for fossil gas support in international agreements such as the [G7 leaders’ communiqué in 2022](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/g7-say-they-wont-compromise-climate-goals-they-tackle-fallout-war-against-ukraine) – despite [earlier commitments](https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20230313124743/https:/ukcop26.org/statement-on-international-public-support-for-the-clean-energy-transition/) to no longer provide public support for foreign fossil fuel projects.
The updated Africa guidelines now say that cooperation in the area of natural gas would be based on two government documents: the ‘[growth initiative](https://www.bmwk.de/Redaktion/DE/Downloads/W/wachstumsinitiative-neue-wirtschaftliche-dynamik-fuer-deutschland.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=6)’ policy programme from July 2024, and the [rules for export credit guarantees](https://www.bmwk.de/Redaktion/DE/Pressemitteilungen/2023/07/20230724-klimapolitische-sektorleitlinien-fur-exportkreditgarantien.html). These allow state support for gas projects, “if these are necessary for national security or geostrategic supply security interests, while complying with the 1.5°C limit and avoiding lock-in effects”.

# Majority of German metering operators yet to install their first smart meter â€“ media

Almost 500 of the 879 companies that operate metering points in Germany are still to install their first smart meter, news magazine Der Spiegel [reported](https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/smart-meter-netzagentur-ermahnt-rund-700-firmen-intelligente-stromzaehler-zu-installieren-a-cba9f7b4-f9b3-458a-a060-a331d7d17468). The Federal Network Agency ([BNetzA](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/federal-network-agency-electricity-gas-telecommunications-post-and-railway-0)) has sent reminders to around 700 companies, largely distribution system operators (DSOs), with threats of fines if they fail to meet installation quotas, according to the report. Germany is aiming to have at least 20 percent of electricity customers with an annual consumption of 6,000 to 100,000 kilowatt hours (kWh) equipped with a smart meter by the end of 2025.
Smart meters are devices that can record how much electricity is used and when. They transmit this data real-time to the electricity provider and grid operator, thus enabling consumers to get charged accordingly when they use electricity when it is abundant and therefore cheap. They are [a perquisite for dynamic electricity tariffs](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/qa-what-are-dynamic-electricity-tariffs-and-why-are-they-central-energy-transition), which should in turn better align the intermittent nature of renewable electricity generation with its use, reducing pressure on grids and making power systems more efficient.
Among EU countries, Germany is lagging far behind in the smart meter rollout and [has been for years](https://www.ecologic.eu/19481), with the government attempting to [relaunch the rollout multiple times](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/electricity-smart-meters-become-standard-german-homes-2032). Increasing flexibility on the power consumption side will be crucial as the share of fluctuating renewable power sources grows in the electricity system.

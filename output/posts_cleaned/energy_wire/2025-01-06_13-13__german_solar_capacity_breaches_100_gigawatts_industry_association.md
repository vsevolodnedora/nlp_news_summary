# German solar capacity breaches 100 gigawatts – industry association

The German solar industry marked a milestone at the turn of the year, as the total capacity of all installed solar power systems [surpassed 100 gigawatts](https://www.solarwirtschaft.de/2025/01/06/photovoltaik-ueberschreitet-100-gigawatt-marke/) (GW), said industry association [BSW Solar.](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bsw-german-solar-industry-association)
Solar power plants covered around 14 percent of electricity consumption in 2024, up from 12 percent the previous year, according to projections based on data from the Federal Network Agency [(BNetzA).](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/federal-network-agency-electricity-gas-telecommunications-post-and-railway-0) Around a million photovoltaic systems with a peak output of 17 GW started operation on rooftops and in open spaces in 2024, up 10 percent on the previous year. 
Ground-mounted solar parks were the main growth drivers with a year-on-year increase of around 40 percent, while demand for plug-in solar on balconies continued to "boom," doubling in capacity (to 0.7 GW). After several record growth years, solar power on residential rooftops slowed, causing problems for [PV](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_p#pv) companies, said [BSW Solar](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bsw-german-solar-industry-association). 
The German government aims to more than double installed solar capacity to 215 GW by 2030. Carsten Körnig, head of [BSW Solar](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bsw-german-solar-industry-association), said that while current growth meant the sector was on the "home straight," reaching the goal was not a forgone conclusion. The next German government formed after elections in February should "remove market barriers and ensure an attractive investment framework." 
Around two-thirds of German citizens want faster solar technology expansion, according to a representative YouGov survey commissioned by [BSW Solar](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bsw-german-solar-industry-association). Lawmakers should ease bureaucracy or introduce appropriate funding instruments to support solar and battery [storage](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_s#storage) growth, with a majority of citizens backing such measures.

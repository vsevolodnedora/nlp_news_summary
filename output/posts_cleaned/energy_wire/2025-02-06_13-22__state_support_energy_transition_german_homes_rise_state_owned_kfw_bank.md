State support granted for [energy efficiency](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_e#energy_efficiency) and renewable energy measures in private households increased to 14.4 billion euros in 2024, up from 12.3 billion euros in 2023, said Germany's state-owned development bank [KfW](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/kfw-bank) in [a press release](https://www.kfw.de/%C3%9Cber-die-KfW/Newsroom/Aktuelles/Pressemitteilungen-Details_836800.html). Demand for the funding support for climate-friendly new construction and for efforts to make homes more energy efficient increased in the fourth quarter in particular, said [KfW](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/kfw-bank).
Demand for the new heating support programme launched at the end of February 2024 rose sharply in the last quarter of the year, with [KfW](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/kfw-bank) issuing approvals for around 227,000 grant applications with a total volume of 3.3 billion euros until the end of 2024.
The past two years were [marked by fierce public debates about a contentious 2023 law to phase out fossil fuels](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/qa-germany-debates-phaseout-fossil-fuel-heating-systems) in Germany’s heating sector, the Building Energy Act. A botched timeline regarding the support measures for households switching to climate-friendly alternatives such as heat pumps caused widespread uncertainty. In 2024, [heat pump sales in Germany dropped ](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/heat-pump-sales-halved-germany-2024-industry-confident-better-times-ahead)[nearly ](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/heat-pump-sales-halved-germany-2024-industry-confident-better-times-ahead)[by half](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/heat-pump-sales-halved-germany-2024-industry-confident-better-times-ahead) due to uncertainties over the law, municipal heat planning and a lack of public knowledge about support programmes.
Germany is aiming to phase out fossil fuels in heating to help bring down emissions in the buildings sector. While climate-friendly heating technologies are now most common in new buildings, the country’s existing buildings [continue to rely](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/four-five-residential-buildings-germany-still-heated-oil-and-gas-energy-agency) heavily on fossil fuels.

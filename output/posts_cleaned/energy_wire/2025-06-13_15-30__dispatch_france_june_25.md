# Dispatch from France | June '25

The talks are potentially fraught with challenges as the plans are far from winning unanimous support. Meanwhile, the massive blackout that parts of France’s territory suffered, alongside Spain and Portugal, has started a debate about the country’s ability to maintain grid stability when demand for electricity falls short of solar and wind power production – even as the cause of the outage has yet to be announced.

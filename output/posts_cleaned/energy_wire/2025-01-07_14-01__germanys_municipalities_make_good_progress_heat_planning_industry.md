More than a third of Germany's municipalities are working on municipal heat planning to help phase out fossil fuel systems, with 13 percent already finished with their plans, [reports news agency dpa](https://www.nordkurier.de/wirtschaft/jede-dritte-kommune-hat-mit-waermeplanung-begonnen-3217583). 
Large municipalities with more than 45,000 inhabitants are the most advanced, with 98 percent having already started or finished their heat planning, [according to](https://www.bdew.de/presse/presseinformationen/kommunale-waermeplanung-kommt-gut-voran-jetzt-braucht-es-ein-waermepaket/) the German Association of Energy and Water Industries [(BDEW)](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bdew-german-association-energy-and-water-industries). 
[BDEW](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bdew-german-association-energy-and-water-industries) chairwoman Kerstin Andreae called the progress "good news" but said that joined up regulations and ordinances as part of a "consistent heating package" were needed to ensure that the momentum continues. 
Late last year, [German media found](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/large-local-utilities-germany-stall-heating-transition-media-report) the country's 11 largest local utilities continued to connect new housing developments to the local gas grid rather than using renewable alternatives. Green lawmakers blamed long lead times for completing heat planning for taking the pressure off to act quickly. At the same time, the first municiaplities have also started to announce a phase-out of their gas grids. Emissions from heating buildings are directly responsible for around 15 percent of the country's entire CO2 output.

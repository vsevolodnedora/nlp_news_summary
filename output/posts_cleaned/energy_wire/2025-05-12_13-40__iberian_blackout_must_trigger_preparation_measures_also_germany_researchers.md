# Iberian blackout must trigger preparation measures also in Germany – researchers
## 
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung
The massive nationwide blackout in Spain and Portugal on 28 April continues to [raise questions across Europe](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/eu-power-grid-needs-trillion-dollar-upgrade-avert-spain-style-blackouts-2025-05-05/) regarding the incident’s origins and the conclusions that need to be drawn in other countries to prevent such a large-scale power outage, energy researchers Christoph Maurer, Lion Hirth and Simon Müller wrote in a [guest article](https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/mehr-wirtschaft/strom-was-aus-dem-spanischen-blackout-gelernt-werden-kann-110467199.html) for the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
“The causes have yet to be clarified – and it will likely take weeks or even months until the events are fully understood,” they said, adding that a combination of factors might have triggered the unprecedented blackout on the Iberian Peninsula, which led to a rare outage of the cross-border transmission grid, rather than only the locally limited distribution grids. The role of renewable energy sources in the blackout is still being clarified, the researchers said, but argued that the lack of so-called inertia in the grid due to a high share of renewables remains an important avenue of investigation.
While Germany’s grid regulator, the Federal Network Agency ([BNetzA](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/federal-network-agency-electricity-gas-telecommunications-post-and-railway-0)), quickly [dismissed the idea that a similar blackout could occur in Germany](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/grid-regulator-says-iberia-power-outage-unlikely-germany-europe-investigates-causes), the three German energy researchers said that “one hundred percent security cannot be achieved here either.” Since the Iberian blackout’s exact causes are still unknown, it is hard to draw conclusions for prevention yet, Hirth, Maurer and Müller said. However, Germany’s power grid is much more closely meshed and better connected to the European continental grid, which reduces the country’s exposure to large-scale disruptions of the electricity network, they added. While the rotation of heavy turbines in conventional power plants had so far provided stability to the grid ([instantaneous reserve](https://www.ewi.uni-koeln.de/en/publications/development-of-the-instantaneous-reserve-and-estimation-of-the-need-for-fast-frequency-response-in-the-european-network-system/)), renewables could likewise - if the right electricity inverters would be installed. However, this was currently lagging behind. 
The new coalition government must soon implement the country’s roadmap for energy system stability that was drafted by the previous government, said the researchers. Moreover, grid-supporting inverters must be made a standard, if necessary through regulation. And third: [Cross-border electricity transmission capacities](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/eu-electricity-market-integration-collides-member-states-uneven-benefits) must be strengthened and expanded.

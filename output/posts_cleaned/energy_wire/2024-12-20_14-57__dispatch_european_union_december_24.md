EU energy ministers finished [their last Council meeting](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/tte/2024/12/16/) of the year in mid-December where they were briefed by the new EU energy commissioner Dan Jørgensen, formerly a climate and energy minister in Denmark and centre-left member of the European Parliament, about the energy prices situation heading into the winter. The new college of 27 EU commissioners – one per member state – have been getting settled in their new offices at a time when a chorus of right-wing voices in Europe are blaming EU climate policy for high energy prices, also in [Germany](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/dossiers/germanys-snap-elections-reaching-2030-climate-and-energy-targets-will-depend-next-government) in the run-up to February’s election. Renewables have, in particular, been blamed for high prices.
“The prices are not high because of renewables, they’re high because we don’t have enough renewables,” he [told journalists](https://audiovisual.ec.europa.eu/en/video/I-265098) following his meeting with the ministers. “Deployment of renewables in Europe has led to a decrease in prices compared to what we would have had if we didn’t have this deployment.”
But Europe’s souring mood on climate policy amid increasing geopolitical tensions and the domestic rise of the far right was evident during the ministers’ discussion on the future of EU energy policy. Commission president Ursula von der Leyen’s Green Deal came in for intense criticism from both the far right and her own centre-right [European Peoples Party](https://www.greeneuropeanjournal.eu/europe-on-the-ballot-how-the-epp-turned-against-climate-politics/) (EPP) during this year’s EU election campaign, and there has been concern she will back away from it in her second term and allow it to be dismantled. A possible early sign of this came in November, when EU lawmakers decided to delay the application of a new EU anti-deforestation law by at least a year. A recently-adopted law to phase out combustion engines by 2035 seems to be [in the crosshairs](https://www.ft.com/content/9b8e685c-622c-467c-ace6-b9dfc203f819) next.

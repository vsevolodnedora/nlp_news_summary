Germany is [halfway to reaching its 2030 solar energy target](https://www.solarwirtschaft.de/2025/07/04/gesetzliches-photovoltaik-ziel-2030-erste-haelfte-ist-geschafft/), with around 107.5 gigawatts (GW) of installed capacity on roofs, balconies, and in open spaces, according to the [German Solar Industry Association (BSW-Solar).](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bsw-german-solar-industry-association)
More than 5 million solar power systems cover about 15 percent of the country's energy needs, said [BSW](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bsw-sahra-wagenknecht-alliance)-Solar, which based its calculations on market data from the [Federal Network Agency.](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/federal-network-agency-electricity-gas-telecommunications-post-and-railway-0)
Still, the lobby group warned that solar growth has slowed recently and that the 2030 target of 215 GW may not be met if the transition to renewable energy stalls.
"We are halfway there, but the next stage is not a sure thing," said Carsten Körnig, head of [BSW](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bsw-sahra-wagenknecht-alliance)-Solar, in a statement, adding that the latest European heat wave was a reminder that "there's no way around stronger expansion of photovoltaics and [storage](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_s#storage)."
Imports of photovoltaic systems [fell sharply in the first four months of 2025](https://www.destatis.de/DE/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/2025/07/PD25_N034_43.html) compared to the same period last year, as did production in Germany, according to [Germany's Federal Statistical Office (Destatis).](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/destatis) [Destatis](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/destatis) noted that import and production data can indicate how the solar market will develop each year. 
[BSW](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bsw-sahra-wagenknecht-alliance) called on the German government to push solar subsidies, expand battery [storage](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_s#storage), and implement measures to accelerate and digitise grid connections, among other steps needed to reach its 2030 target.

# German industry supplier says US tariffs could cut global car production by millions
## 
WirtschaftsWoche 
The tariff policies of US president Donald Trump are likely to lead to a massive drop in global automobile production, the CEO of German automotive industry supplier Mahle, Arnd Franz, has warned in an [article](https://www.wiwo.de/unternehmen/auto/autozulieferer-mahle-warnt-wegen-den-zoellen-werden-bis-zu-5-millionen-autos-weniger-gebaut/100121844.html) carried by business weekly WirtschaftsWoche. The sweeping tariffs introduced by the Trump administration mean that “at least” 1.5 million fewer cars would be produced in 2025, with the reduction possibly reaching five million units in a worst-case scenario without any working trade agreement being found.
The expected slump in the industry means that Europe must leave its “special path” of regulating the future of combustion engine technology, Franz argued, adding that the EU’s planned 2035 ban on new combustion engine vehicle registrations will have “massive consequences” on its workforce. Combustion engine components account for the bulk of Mahle’s revenue. Germany should work towards delaying the planned ban within the next one to two years to support the industry, he said.
Like many other automotive suppliers, Mahle is already grappling with weak global sales figures and challenges related to the transition to electric mobility. The US tariffs are now adding a “dramatic” impact for the company, as major clients have scaled back orders and halted production at factories in North America, Franz added. “We can’t just stomach that,” he argued, adding that US consumers would bear the brunt of higher prices.
However, while the company tried to reroute supply chains to source more from the US directly, Franz said it was unclear whether the company is going to invest in the US market given the significant political volatility in the country. “There’s no way around China,” the manager said with a view to the company’s investment targets. Mahle would need to gain more experience on the Chinese market to make headway in key electric mobility fields, he added.

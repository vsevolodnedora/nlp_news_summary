The 25-million-euro greenwashing fine for Deutsche Bank-owned asset manager DWS is a clear sign that deception regarding sustainable funds will be penalised, wrote journalist Meike Schreiber in [a commentary](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/meinung/kommentar-dws-greenwashing-strafe-kommentar-li.3230060) in Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ). Sustainable investing may be “no longer quite as fashionable as it was five years ago” but “the entire financial sector should take this fine as a warning”, she wrote.
German prosecutors fined DWS 25 million euros after a lengthy probe found the firm guilty of greenwashing, or making misleading statements about its credentials regarding the ESG (environmental, social, governance) criteria for sustainable investments, [reported Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/german-asset-manager-dws-fined-25-mln-eur-greenwashing-case-2025-04-02/). Statements by DWS that it was a “leader” in ESG investing, and that this was an integral part of its corporate identity, did not correspond to reality, the Frankfurt state prosecutors said. The penalty came after [US authorities in 2023 imposed a fine of 25 million dollars](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/25-mln-us-fine-german-fund-manager-sustainable-finance-wake-call-ngo) to settle charges over misstatements linked to ESG investing, and for failures in policies designed to prevent money laundering.
[Greening global financial sectors](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/dossiers/too-big-just-stand-germanys-financial-sector-faces-climate-challenge) is key to reaching climate targets and sustainable investments are a crucial part of this endeavour. However, greenwashing cases, such as misleading ESG claims, continue to present a hurdle. Other sectors also struggle to deal with false claims, for example surrounding “[climate neutral” products](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/dossiers/clew-focus-climate-neutral-products-and-companies-greenwashing-or-sign-hope).

The price of gas for new customers in Germany has risen sharply over the past year, [said](https://www.verivox.de/gas/nachrichten/gaspreise-fuer-neukunden-in-12-monaten-um-43-prozent-gestiegen-1121062/) price comparison website Verivox. The average price across Germany increased by 43 percent, from 7 to 10 cents per kilowatt hour since the beginning of February 2024, Verivox reported. It attributed the rise to the [reintroduction of the full value added tax](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/germany-reduces-vat-gas-relieve-consumers) rate of 19 percent on natural gas in April 2024, which by itself had led to a gas price increase of 11 percent. The increase in average [grid fees](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/higher-grid-fees-could-lead-sudden-increase-gas-prices-german-households-2025), the gas [storage](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_s#storage) levy and the increased [CO2 price](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/germanys-planned-carbon-pricing-system-transport-and-buildings) since the beginning of 2025 have also contributed to higher average prices.
Verivox said that the wholesale price of gas has doubled in the past 12 months. “We currently see no signs of wholesale gas prices falling in the long term,” said Verivox’s energy expert Thorsten Storck. The average household would now have to pay around 600 euros more per year for gas, he added.
German households and industry have been facing [higher gas prices](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/dossiers/europes-gas-crisis-boon-or-bane-climate-policy-ambitions) since the end of the pandemic and the intensifying geopolitical tensions between Russia and the West. Additionally, households [must shoulder increasing heating costs](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/consumers-not-sufficiently-prepared-cost-increases-eu-carbon-price-env-agency) due to a politically induced rise in CO2 prices.

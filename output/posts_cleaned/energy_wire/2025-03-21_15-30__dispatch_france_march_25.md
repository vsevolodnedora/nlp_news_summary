# Dispatch from France | March '25
French prime minister Francois Bayrou may have fended off a vote of no-confidence in parliament for the adoption of the 2025 finance bill, but the nation still has a long way to go to recover from the political turmoil brought by last June’s dissolution of the National Assembly. That is, if it is given enough time to do so. Far from winning unanimous support, a plan setting out France's energy strategy over the coming decade might soon bring the downfall of yet another government. Meanwhile, Donald Trump’s return as US president is reigniting Franco-German relations, which soon-to-be chancellor Friedrich Merz and French president Emmanuel Macron appear keen to revive.

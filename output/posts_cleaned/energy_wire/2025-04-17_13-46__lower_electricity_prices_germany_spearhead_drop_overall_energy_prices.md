A drop in energy prices has led to an overall reduction in production prices in Germany over the past twelve months, the countryâ€™s statistical office [Destatis](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/destatis) has [said](https://www.destatis.de/DE/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/2025/04/PD25_149_61241.html). On average, energy was 3.6 percent cheaper in March 2025 than one year earlier, leading to an overall price drop of 0.2 percent. Excluding energy, production prices increased 1.4 percent compared to March 2024, [Destatis](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/destatis) added.
The highest contribution to the overall drop in energy prices came from lower electricity prices. These dropped 4.3 percent over one year on average for all groups of customers. Natural gas was 3.6 percent cheaper than in the same month one year ago. Oil products were 5.8 percent cheaper and fuel prices were 6.1 percent lower than in March 2024.
The drop in production prices came as a surprise to analysts, who had predicted a 0.4 percent increase for March, news agency dpa said in an [article](https://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/2025-04/energiekosten-erzeugerpreise-deutschland-strom) published on Zeit Online. Production prices increased 0.7 percent in February. Production prices reflect the costs for producers and ultimately also influence the prices paid by consumers.

# Germany cancels first emissions allowances freed up by coal exit
## 
Clean Energy Wire
Germany has for the first time cancelled more than 500,000 emission certificates from the European Union Emissions Trading System ([EU ETS](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_e#eu_ets)) to secure the positive climate impact of its [coal phase-out](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_c#coal_phase-out). [According to](https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/deutschland-loescht-ueber-500000) environment agency [UBA](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/uba-federal-environment-agency), cancelling the freed up allowances ensures that they cannot be used by other countries to emit more CO2, a mechanism known as [the "waterbed effect."](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/waterbed-effect-threatens-coal-exits-climate-impact-govt-shuns-deleting-allowances-media) A total of 514,000 tonnes of CO2 will be withdrawn from the market.
This follows the closure of the Neurath A and Frechen power stations in 2022, in line with the country's [coal exit](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_c#coal_exit) schedule. This plan aims to completely phase out coal by 2038. Closing the plants avoided around 890,000 tonnes of COâ‚‚ emissions the following year, and the [coal phase-out](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_c#coal_phase-out) is expected to lead to further reductions in emissions in the coming years. This will also result in regular national certificate cancellations in accordance with legal requirements.
The [EU ETS](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_e#eu_ets), which puts a price on CO2 emissions that contribute to climate change, [has been a key driver of decarbonisation in energy and industry](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/understanding-european-unions-emissions-trading-system) for years. Recent reforms have increased the price, providing companies with greater incentives to reduce their consumption of fossil fuels.

# Germany can meet future hydrogen storage needs with salt caverns – econ ministry
## 
Clean Energy Wire / Tagesspiegel Background
Germany can store enough hydrogen in salt caverns alone to meet more than the maximum expected national and European demand needs, the economy ministry ([BMWK](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bmwk-federal-ministry-economic-affairs-and-climate-action)) has said [in a white paper on hydrogen storage](https://www.bmwk.de/Redaktion/DE/Publikationen/Energie/weissbuch-wasserstoffspeicher-2025.html), which is set to form the basis for the next government’s work on hydrogen. "Germany has ideal geological conditions to meet its own hydrogen [storage](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_s#storage) needs and those of its European neighbours," the ministry wrote in [a press release](https://www.bmwk.de/Redaktion/DE/Pressemitteilungen/2025/20250417-bmwk-veroeffentlicht-weissbuch-wasserstoffspeicher.html). "Salt caverns offer particularly great potential for the long-term [storage](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_s#storage) of large quantities of hydrogen."
In turn, [storage](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_s#storage) in porous rock formations, which are found largely in southern Germany, is associated with considerable uncertainties, the ministry said, adding that it would therefore not further analyse their potential. "This would mean that southern Germany, with its energy-intensive industry, would be largely cut off from direct access to hydrogen [storage](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_s#storage) facilities," energy and climate newsletter Tagesspiegel Background reported. Scientific advisors and industry associations have [previously called](https://www.dena.de/infocenter/aufbau-und-finanzierung-von-wasserstoffspeichern-in-deutschland/) on the government to use porous [storage](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_s#storage), it added.
Salt caverns are artificial cavities in underground salt formations, which are created by the controlled dissolution of rock salt by injection of water. On top of having many salt caverns, Germany also has comparatively large amount of natural gas [storage](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_s#storage) capacity which [could be converted to hydrogen storage](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/german-govt-co-funds-conversion-natural-gas-cavern-hydrogen-storage). Natural gas is currently stored at 47 locations in Germany, but there are no pure hydrogen [storage](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_s#storage) facilities yet, Tagesspiegel Background reported. Two thirds of the [storage](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_s#storage) capacity is found in caverns, while one third is porous [storage](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_s#storage).
Hydrogen [storage](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_s#storage) demand is set to rise from 2-7 terawatt hours (TWh) in 2030 to between 76 and 80 TWh by 2045, the white paper stated. So-called green hydrogen made with renewable electricity [is seen as crucial to decarbonise certain industry processes](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/germanys-national-hydrogen-strategy) and for large-scale renewable power [storage](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_s#storage), thus helping to make the economy climate-neutral.

Around two-thirds of homeowners in Germany plan to have a solar power system installed by 2029, [according to a survey](https://initiative-klimaneutral.de/presse/eigenheimbesitzer-wollen-in-solaranlagen-waermepumpen-und-elektroautos-investieren) commissioned by Munich-based climate NGO Initiative Klimaneutrales Deutschland. 
Sixty-five percent of the more than [4,000 respondents](https://initiative-klimaneutral.de/fileadmin/iknd_content/Publikationen/2502_IKND_Eigenheimer_Technologien.pdf) to the representative survey said they planned to harness power from the sun by 2029 (36% already have a system installed, 29% plan to), while 41 percent were considering buying an electric vehicle (29%) or own one already (12%). Some 23 percent were thinking about purchasing a heat pump (15% have one installed).
The survey showed a general uptick in the number of homeowners planning a clean technology purchase, with solar driving the interest, while political preferences didn't play a significant role in whether individuals were likely to invest in such technologies, said the NGO. Those with monthly incomes above 2,500 euros were more likely to say they are planning to invest in solar energy and electric cars. Those who were not tempted to invest in green power solutions at home - usually people earning less than 2,500 euros a month – blamed the cost.
Homeownership in Germany is among the lowest in the EU, with just under half of the population living in their own homes. The German public put climate action at the top of its policy priorities for several years and remained strongly in support of the transition to a low-carbon economy, [according to a poll](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/polls-reveal-citizens-support-energiewende) conducted late last year by the Renewable Energies Agency ([AEE](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/renewable-energies-agency)). However, the affordability of the energy transition in people's homes is [set to take centre stage](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/vote25-analysis-germany-buildings-heating-transition-next-german-government) for the next German legislative period. The country has only just begun to [cut emission from its buildings](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/qa-germany-debates-phaseout-fossil-fuel-heating-systems) in earnest, but [concerns abound](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/socially-just-climate-policy-should-be-next-german-govts-focus-foundation) over whether everyone can [afford to implement](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/must-focus-social-dimension-climate-friendly-transformation-survey-shows-uba-head) the necessary measures.

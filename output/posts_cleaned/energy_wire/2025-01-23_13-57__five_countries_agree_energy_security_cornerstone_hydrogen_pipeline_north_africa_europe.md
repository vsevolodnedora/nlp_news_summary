Government representatives from Algeria, Austria, Italy, Germany, and Tunisia have signed a joint letter of intent for a new hydrogen corridor that should connect southern Europe with northern Africa via the Mediterranean Sea, the German economy ministry ([BMWK](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bmwk-federal-ministry-economic-affairs-and-climate-action)) has [said](https://www.bmwk.de/Redaktion/DE/Pressemitteilungen/2025/20250121-gemeinsame-politische-absichtserklaerung-entwicklung-des-suedlichen-wasserstoffkorridors.html). At a meeting in Italy’s capital Rome that was also attended by representatives of Switzerland and the European Commission, the five countries agreed on plans to build a hydrogen pipeline with a length of more than 3,500 kilometres which is supposed to transport more than 163 terawatt hours (TWh) of the gas per year, out of which 55 TWh would go to Germany. Up to two thirds of the larger European part of the new transport corridor could be constructed with retrofitted natural gas pipelines. Several hydrogen infrastructure projects along the corridor running from Sicily to Bavaria had already been agreed as so-called “Projects of Common Interest” in the EU.
Regarding hydrogen production, Tunisia has signed ten different letters of intent for hydrogen infrastructure projects while Algeria announced the launch of a large-scale production project in partnership with companies from the involved European states. Philip Nimmermann, state secretary in Germany’s economy ministry, commented that the southern hydrogen corridor is “one of the largest and most significant renewable energy projects of our time.” The joint letter of intent would strengthen the new “bridge between North Africa and Europe” and [make Africa’s “immense potential” for producing the renewable gas accessible for Germany](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/germany-open-fossil-gas-and-hydrogen-cooperation-african-countries) and other EU states. “German companies can be important partners and support Algeria and Tunisia in diversifying local economies and making them fit for the future with new jobs,” Nimmermann added.
“This initiative is supposed to become a cornerstone of European energy security and [decarbonisation](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_d#decarbonisation) strategies,” the ministry said. In a next step, the exact outline of the pipeline segment that connects North Africa would have to be made. The partnering countries said they would collaborate closely on establishing a “robust value creation chain” that considers local needs and sustainability aspects.

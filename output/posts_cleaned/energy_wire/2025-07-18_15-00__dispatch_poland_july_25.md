# Dispatch from Poland | July '25
This year’s summer in Poland is characterised not only by extreme weather events, but also by political turmoil. While heatwaves and heavy rains roll through the country, prime minister Donald Tusk’s government still appears unable to find its bearings following a loss in the presidential election. A long-announced government reshuffle is meant to pave the way for a restart. But, facing a new right-wing president and gains by the opposition in polls, Tusk’s ruling coalition appears to be fighting for survival. And there is mixed fortunes in the country’s energy transition: Poland crossed a milestone in renewable energy, but took a substantial step back in making the building sector more climate-friendly.

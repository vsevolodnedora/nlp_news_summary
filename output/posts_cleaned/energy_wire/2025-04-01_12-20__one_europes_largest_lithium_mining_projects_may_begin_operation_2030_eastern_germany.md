# International investors prepare major lithium mining project in eastern Germany
## 
Clean Energy Wire / MDR / epd / Tagesspiegel Background
UK mining and metals company Zinnwald Lithium could begin lithium mining operations in Germany’s Eastern Ore Mountains as soon as in 2030 in what is estimated to be “[one of the largest integrated lithium operations in Europe](https://investors.zinnwaldlithium.com/announcements/6888258)”. Located in the state of Saxony along the Czech border, the Zinnwald Lithium project is described as strategic and positioned “to support Europe's lithium supply chain.”
Lithium is seen as a critical raw material for Europe’s energy transition. A key component of batteries that store renewable energy for cars, households and industrial plants, lithium has become essential for [decarbonisation](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_d#decarbonisation) strategies around the world. [Demand for lithium ](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/green-resources-reuse-and-recycling-are-key-cleaner-e-car-batteries)[is](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/green-resources-reuse-and-recycling-are-key-cleaner-e-car-batteries)[ projected to ](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/green-resources-reuse-and-recycling-are-key-cleaner-e-car-batteries)[multiply by 60](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/green-resources-reuse-and-recycling-are-key-cleaner-e-car-batteries)[ by 2050](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/green-resources-reuse-and-recycling-are-key-cleaner-e-car-batteries).
As Germany and Europe focus on energy diversification and supply security, domestic mining operations like Zinnwald [have become increasingly significant](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/germany-welcomes-eu-plans-lead-global-shift-climate-neutral-industry). According to the project’s [pre-feasibility ](https://www.rns-pdf.londonstockexchange.com/rns/8115C_1-2025-3-30.pdf)[study](https://www.rns-pdf.londonstockexchange.com/rns/8115C_1-2025-3-30.pdf), the mining operations are forecast to produce 18,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide monohydrate (LHM) a year in their first phase – enough to equip 800,000 electric vehicles with batteries, reported[ broadcaster MDR and news agency epd](https://www.mdr.de/nachrichten/sachsen/dresden/dippoldiswalde-sebnitz/lithium-abbau-altenberg-zinnwald-kritik-anwohner-100.html). Phase 2 would see increased production of 35,100 tonnes a year. The project has a mine life of over 40 years, said the pre-feasibility study.
A cash flow of 12.1 billion euros is expected over the mine’s entire operating period, as are annual profits (EBITDA) of just under 10.3 million euros, [Tagesspiegel Background reported](https://background.tagesspiegel.de/energie-und-klima/briefing/zinnwald-lithium-trifft-auf-thermalwasser-konkurrenz). Development costs for the project are estimated at one billion euros.
The Zinnwald production facility would be powered by renewable energy, with mining operations carried out in a "surface-friendly" manner at a depth of approximately 100 to 400 metres below ground, said Marko Uhlig, head of Zinnwald Lithium GmbH, the group’s German subsidiary. Uhlig described lithium mining as "sustainable, low disruption and low risk." Local residents and a citizens’ initiative have expressed concerns about the project’s environmental impact while profits flow abroad.
The EU recently unveiled 47 "[strategic projects](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_864)" to secure and diversify access to raw materials, part of its Critical Raw Material Act agreed in 2023 to reduce dependencies and boost domestic mining for materials critical for the energy transition.

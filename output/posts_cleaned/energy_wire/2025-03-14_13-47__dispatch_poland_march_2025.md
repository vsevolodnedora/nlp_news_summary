# Dispatch from Poland | March 2025 
The public debate in Poland in recent weeks has been dominated by international security and the implications of the rift between the new US administration and Europe on Ukraine. Beyond the frontpage news, there has been progress on some elements of the energy transition: a long-awaited bill for [onshore wind](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_o#onshore_wind) has passed, the expansion of [offshore wind](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_o#offshore_wind) capacity has started and a national nuclear power programme has been established. Poland is also nearing the halfway point of its EU Council presidency. The country hoped to use it to influence some of the EU's climate policies, like the ETS2, but has not yet achieved much. While some towns in southern Poland are still recovering from climate-fuelled floods in September, the country is threatened with drought as the winter draws to a close.

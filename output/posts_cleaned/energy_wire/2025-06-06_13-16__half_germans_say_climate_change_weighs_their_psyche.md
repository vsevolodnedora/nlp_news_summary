One in two Germans say they feel weighed down psychologically by climate change and its effects. In a survey, 53 percent of respondents [told](https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/klimawandel-als-psychische-belastung) the country’s Federal Environment Agency ([UBA](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/uba-federal-environment-agency)) that mentally, they felt strongly or very strongly affected by climate change. 
“Climate change can not only have devastating physical consequences for people and the environment, it can also severely affect the human psyche,” the agency said. “For example, extreme weather events can trigger post-traumatic stress disorder, and concerns about our livelihoods can cause fears about the future and depression.”
"In order to mitigate climate change, we need people with a resilient psyche who are capable of taking action," said [UBA](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/uba-federal-environment-agency) president Dirk Messner. "That's why we need to help people recognise and cope not only with the physical but also the mental consequences of climate change," he added. 
The agency said there are several options to counter negative feelings related to climate change. This included being mindful of one's own feelings and sharing them with others. “The research project shows that it is sometimes most effective to campaign for consistent climate protection yourself, preferably together with other people,” the [UBA](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/uba-federal-environment-agency) said.
In [earlier surveys](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/two-five-young-germans-feel-effects-climate-change-health-survey), more than 40 percent of young Germans said that climate change has negative effects on their mental and physical health. In 2022, the German psychiatry association ([DGPPN](https://dgppn.de/schwerpunkte/klima-und-psyche.html)) called for better political support for mental health care through the climate crisis.

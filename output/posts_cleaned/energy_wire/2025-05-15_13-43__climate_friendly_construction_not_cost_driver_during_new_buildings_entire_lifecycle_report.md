# Climate friendly construction not a cost driver over new buildings' entire lifecycle – report
## 
Clean Energy Wire
Climate-friendly homes are not necessarily more expensive than their more polluting counterparts when accounting for a building's entire lifecycle, a [joint report](https://www.dgnb.de/de/dgnb-richtig-nutzen/newsroom/presse/artikel/gebaeude-studie-belegt-mehr-klimaschutz-im-bauen-muss-nicht-zu-mehr-kosten-fuehren) by think tank [BPIE](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bpie-buildings-performance-institute-europe) and green-building certifier [DGNB](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/dgnb-german-sustainable-building-council) found. When assessing the residential buildings throughout their entire lifetime – meaning taking its construction, use-phase and end of life into account – the authors found no correlation between buildings in terms of their climate impact and construction costs.
Stakeholders in Germany's construction industry [have in the past complained](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/german-government-suspend-tightening-building-efficiency-rules) that stringent climate regulations in the buildings sector, especially tighter efficiency standards, make constructing new homes and offices [much too expensive](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/germanys-efficiency-standards-new-builds-fatal-affordable-housing-renovations-key-industry), leading [construction orders to tumble](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/construction-minister-opposes-stricter-efficiency-standards-housing-sector-tumbles).
"The fact that the independent study proves that this claim has no factual basis is good news," said Christine Lemaitre, managing director at [DGNB](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/dgnb-german-sustainable-building-council). "It is absolutely possible to construct and operate buildings at low cost that cause low CO2 emissions and achieve a very good certification result."
The authors assessed the climate impact and costs of 28 [DGNB](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/dgnb-german-sustainable-building-council)-certified residential buildings and found that there was no clear correlation between the life cycle assessment values and the construction costs of the properties. Even the most climate-friendly buildings which achieved higher certification levels were not more expensive to construct. "The assumption that there is a fundamental link between low CO2 emissions during operation and higher construction costs was also not confirmed," the authors wrote. They recommended use-costs and environmental impacts to be considered early in the planning phase to optimise costs over the lifecycle.
For new buildings, construction materials and methods already account for around [half of the emissions attributable to them](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/sustainable-construction-climate-friendly-buildings-europe), with the other half coming from heating and lighting during their use phase. Adopting [more circular construction practices](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/circular-economy-construction-europe), as well as [using climate-friendly materials](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/what-are-best-materials-sustainable-construction-and-renovation) thus has a huge leverage to [lower buildings' environmental footprints](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/climate-and-environmental-impacts-of-construction).

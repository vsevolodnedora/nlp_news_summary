# Electrification, new technologies needed to achieve climate neutrality in Germany – report

Clean Energy Wire
In addition to electrification and a massive ramp-up of renewables, a greater use of diverse technologies such as seasonal heat [storage](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_s#storage) or feed additives that reduce methane emissions from cattle are vital measures that could help Germany reach climate neutrality by 2045, [according to](https://www.agora-energiewende.de/publikationen/klimaneutrales-deutschland-szenariopfade#key-findings) think tank [Agora Energiewende](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/agora-energiewende).
In a report titled [Climate-Neutral Germany – From Objectives to Implementation](https://www.agora-energiewende.de/fileadmin/Projekte/2023/2023-30_DE_KNDE_Update/A-EW_349_KNDE_Szenariopfade_WEB.pdf), it examines how a balanced mix of policies, socially just measures and targeted funding can address the current challenges facing Germany’s energy transition. The sustainable use of biomass and new technologies, for example, are identified as key building blocks.
“Woody plants on agricultural land make a significant contribution to [biomass production](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/germanys-biomass-strategy-focus-sustainable-use-and-climate-protection),” the report notes. Biomass in particular can serve as a building material or chemical raw material and is increasingly being used in “cascading” – the efficient use and recycling of natural resources for as long as possible.
Electrification is seen as another key lever, as it would enable industries to reduce emissions cost-effectively. An ambitious expansion of renewables is necessary for the transition in the building and transport sectors, which, by 2045, could reduce dependence on energy imports by around 85 percent.
The report notes that “swift decisions and a clever policy mix” can mobilise necessary investments for major infrastructure projects, such as hydrogen networks, power plants and charging infrastructure.“[A] reliable CO₂ price path encourages investment, market regulation ensures planning security and targeted funding facilitates initial investments,” the report stresses.
Germany aims to become [greenhouse gas](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_g#greenhouse_gas) neutral by 2045, which requires significant changes across all sectors, including transport, agriculture, buildings and the energy industry.

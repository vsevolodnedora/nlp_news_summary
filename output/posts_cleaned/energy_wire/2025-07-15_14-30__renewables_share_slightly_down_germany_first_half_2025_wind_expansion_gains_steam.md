# Renewables share slightly down in Germany in first half of 2025, but wind expansion gains steam

Despite the ongoing expansion of Germany's wind and solar power capacity, renewables provided 54 percent of electricity consumption between January and the end of June 2025, a slight drop compared to the same period last year (57%), industry figures have shown. Exceptionally weak winds were the key reason for the decrease. At the same time, the buildout and licensing of [onshore wind](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_o#onshore_wind) power has reached a dynamic not seen in almost a decade and a fast expansion of the country's most important renewable power source appears to be locked-in for years, industry representatives have said. However, Germany still lags behind its official expansion targets - and researchers warn that the government must avoid disrupting the current trend by worsening planning conditions. 
Renewable energy sources covered about 54 percent of Germany’s electricity consumption in the first half of 2025, down from a share of 57 percent during the same period a year before, energy industry group BDEW [has found](https://www.bdew.de/presse/erneuerbare-energien-stromverbrauch-2025/). Wind turbines, solar panels and other renewable sources produced about 141 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity between January and the end of June, 5.4 percent less than in the first half 2024, with [BDEW](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bdew-german-association-energy-and-water-industries) linking the drop primarily to unfavourable weather conditions.
Wind power saw a particularly large drop of more than 17 percent in output due to “historically” weak winds in the first quarter of the year, the group said based on the figures it had reviewed together with research institute [ZSW](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/centre-solar-energy-and-hydrogen-research-baden-wuerttemberg). However, wind turbines still covered nearly a quarter of electricity demand.
At the same time, low precipitation caused a significant reduction in [hydropower](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_h#hydropower) output, which dropped nearly 30 percent compared to the previous year, in which Germany had abundant rainfall. A lack of melting water in spring exacerbated the drop in [hydropower](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_h#hydropower) production, which saw its lowest output in 20 years, [BDEW](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bdew-german-association-energy-and-water-industries) added.
Power production with solar [PV](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_p#pv) installations, meanwhile, increased markedly thanks to the ongoing expansion boom for the technology: solar [PV](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_p#pv) climbed 23 percent compared to 2024 and each month of 2025 eclipsed its counterpart from the year before, the figures showed. “But this strong growth was not enough to fully compensate for the drop in wind power,” [BDEW](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bdew-german-association-energy-and-water-industries) said.
“Despite the weather-related oscillations, these figures show that renewables have long become the load-bearing pillar for the electricity supply of Europe’s most important industrialised country,” said Frithjof Staiß, managing director at [ZSW](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/centre-solar-energy-and-hydrogen-research-baden-wuerttemberg). Reliable planning conditions would be the most important factor for protecting the competitiveness of German industry and generate gains in line with the EU’s Green Industrial Deal, Staiß added.
Wind industry group [BWE](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bwe-german-wind-energy-association) also [published](https://www.wind-energie.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/detail/starkes-volumen-bei-genehmigungen-und-zubau-ausbauambitionen-wahren/) figures for the first half of 2025, in which Germany saw its greatest expansion since 2017, with 409 newly constructed turbines with a combined capacity of 2.2 gigawatts (GW). At the same time, more than 1,250 new turbines with a capacity of 7.8 GW were licensed so far this year, the highest volume ever achieved in this timespan. “Wind energy is getting on course,” said [BWE](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bwe-german-wind-energy-association) head Bärbel Heidebroek, adding that further expansion “at a high level” had already been locked in for the next years.
However, despite the positive trend, the buildout still lags behind government targets fixed in the [Renewable Energy Act](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_e#renewable_energy_act) ([EEG](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_e#eeg)). Germany would be back on track for these targets "from 2026 at the earliest,” Heidebroek added, calling on policymakers to sustain the current dynamic in the industry. “It now is about holding course and implementing the expansion targets for renewables,” she argued.
Germany's new economy and energy minister, Katherina Reiche from the conservative Christian Democratic Union ([CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)), has caused worries among NGOs and industry observers by announcing a monitoring report of the energy transition that is meant to serve as the government's blueprint for energy policy in the coming years.
Critics have said that the minister's [monitoring could choke off expansion](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/critics-warn-germanys-energy-transition-reality-check-designed-slow-renewables) by underestimating the demand for electricity and new installations until 2030. Reiche has argued that the so-called "reality check" of the energy transition is meant to reduce costs and increase energy supply security rather than focussing on maximising emissions reduction.

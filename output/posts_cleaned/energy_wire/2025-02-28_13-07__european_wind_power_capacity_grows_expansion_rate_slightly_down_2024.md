# European wind power capacity grows but expansion rate slightly down in 2024

Europe installed a total 16.4 gigawatt (GW) of new wind power capacity in 2024, down from 18.4 GW achieved in the previous year, according to [data](https://windeurope.org/intelligence-platform/product/wind-energy-in-europe-2024-statistics-and-the-outlook-for-2025-2030/) by industry association WindEurope. "Europe’s wind energy continues to grow but only at half the rate we need," [said](https://windeurope.org/newsroom/press-releases/building-more-wind-is-key-to-deliver-the-eu-clean-industrial-deal/) CEO Giles Dickson. "Three things are holding us back: cumbersome permitting, slow grid build-out and insufficient electrification."
With an added capacity of 4 GW, Germany led last year's growth, followed by the UK (1.9 GW) and France (1.7 GW). In total, Europe now boasts a wind power capacity of 285 GW, of which 248 GW are installed onshore and 37 GW offshore. "Europe awarded more new wind capacity in government auctions than ever before. The 37 GW awarded (29 GW in the EU) are in theory good news for the future pipeline and build-out," WindEurope wrote in a press release. At 56 percent, Denmark achieved the highest share of wind power in its electricity mix in 2024. The country was followed by Ireland (33%) and Sweden (31%).
Expanding onshore and [offshore wind](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_o#offshore_wind) power capacity is a key part of Europe's drive to reach climate neutrality. WindEurope called on governments to apply new EU permitting rules and filter grid connection requests to prioritise strategic projects currently awaiting connection permits.
The past year was “[a record year](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/industry-groups-hopeful-after-2024-record-year-onshore-wind-power-germany)” for [onshore wind](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_o#onshore_wind) power in Germany, and the country [looks likely](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/germany-likely-exceed-2030-onshore-wind-power-targets-think-tank) to exceed its 2030 target by 2.6 percent, according to an analysis by the Google-backed think tank Goal100. Considering the number of applications and permits for new wind farms, and the shortening of approval processes, the think tank found that the country would likely exceed its target of 115 gigawatts (GW) of installed wind capacity by 2030 by 3 GW.

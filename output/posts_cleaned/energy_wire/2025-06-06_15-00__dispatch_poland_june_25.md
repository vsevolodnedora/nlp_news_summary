# Dispatch from Poland | June '25
Poland’s newly elected president, Karol Nawrocki, brings strong backing from the right-wing party Law and Justice (PiS) and he has shown a hardline stance against EU climate policies. Like his predecessor Andrzej Duda, Nawrocki has defended coal and opposed the EU Green Deal, yet these positions have not stopped Poland’s slow shift toward cleaner energy. Still, his win introduces fresh political tensions with the current pro-EU government, especially as Poland is late in submitting its climate strategy to Brussels. As coal’s role in electricity generation has fallen to a historic low and large-scale nuclear and wind initiatives inch forward, the coming weeks and months will reveal whether Poland’s energy transition can stay on course amid deepening political divides.

On energy and climate policy, he pledged [to oppose the EU Green Deal ](https://oko.press/nawrocki-chce-zatrzymac-europejski-zielony-lad-ale-donald-tusk-tez-nie-jest-jego-fanem)and to [hold a referendum on rejecting it](https://www.pap.pl/aktualnosci/nawrocki-w-sprawie-zielonego-ladu-powinni-wypowiedziec-sie-wszyscy-polacy-w-referendum), arguing that Poland cannot abandon coal. However, Poland’s president does not have the authority to unilaterally withdraw Poland from EU climate commitments. Nawrocki will take office from the incumbent Andrzej Duda, also a PiS ally, in August.

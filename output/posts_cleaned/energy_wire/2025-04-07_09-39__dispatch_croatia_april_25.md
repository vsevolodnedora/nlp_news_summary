# Dispatch from Croatia | April ‘25
Croatia is making moves on renewable energy reform, including new rules for self-supply, [storage](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_s#storage), and energy communities, but long-standing challenges persist. Grid bottlenecks continue to slow solar expansion, and major energy infrastructure components remain outdated - while the government uses subsidies to keep electricity prices stable. At the same time, a momentum is building around geothermal potential and for creating a subsea electricity link with Italy.

Stories to watch in the weeks ahead
**Croatia’s Janaf secures new permit for NIS oil transit -** Crude oil transport company [Janaf, which is majority state-owned, ](https://www.janaf.hr/)received a [new 30-day permit](https://janaf.hr/vijesti/2433#0) at the end of March to [transport oil to Pančevo](https://www.tportal.hr/biznis/clanak/janafu-dobio-jednomjesecnu-licencu-za-transport-nafte-u-pancevo-20250329). The move effectively postpones US sanctions against Serbian refinery NIS, which is majority-owned by Russia’s Gazprom, for the second time. Janaf and NIS have a contract for oil transport valid until the end of 2026. A few days before Janaf was granted the new one-month permit, economy minister [Ante Šušnjar announced that Janaf could acquire a stake in NIS](https://mingo.gov.hr/vijesti/ministar-susnjar-gostovao-u-sredisnjem-dnevniku-htv-a-ulaskom-u-vlasnicku-strukturu-nis-a-ojacali-bi-poziciju-janaf-a/10004), stating that there are no regulatory obstacles to such a move. The Janaf-NIS deal could go ahead in the coming weeks, highlighting how many fossil fuel projects receive significant political attention, while renewable development is often neglected.
**Updates to Renewable Energy Framework -** From 28 February to 14 March, a [public consultation was held on the draft amendments to the Renewable Energy Sources Act](https://esavjetovanja.gov.hr/ECon/MainScreen?entityId=30005), under the jurisdiction of the [Ministry of Economy](https://mingo.gov.hr/). The new law raises the national 2030 target for the use of [renewable energy to a share of 42.5 percent](https://www.energetika-net.com/obnovljivi-izvori/u-javnoj-raspravi-su-izmjene-zakona-o-obnovljivim-izvorima-energije-i-visokucinkovitoj-kogeneraciji) and introduces a new system for self-supply of electricity and charges for active consumers, along with [incentives to form energy communities](https://www.zez.coop/sto-donose-predlozene-izmjene-zakona-o-obnovljivim-izvorima-energije/). The law also aims to simplify administrative procedures, introduce clearer rules for green subsidies and biomass, and develop infrastructure for energy [storage](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_s#storage) and the integration of renewable energy sources into the power system. The draft sets out the procedure for registering renewable energy communities, including the establishment and maintenance of a registry, which must be carried out by Croatian Energy Regulatory Agency (HERA) within six months.
**Croatia and Italy mull subsea electricity link across Adriatic Sea -**[Geothermal and nuclear energy](https://mingo.gov.hr/vijesti/ministar-susnjar-nuklearna-energija-kljucan-je-dio-energetske-buducnosti-hrvatske/9948) are strategic [steps towards ensuring Croatia’s energy security](https://ceenergynews.com/electricity/nuclear-geothermal-energy-croatia-plans/), economy minister Ante Šušnjar told the conference [“Energy Revolution – The Path to a Sustainable Future”](https://www.poslovni.hr/hrvatska/susnjar-trebamo-vlastitu-nuklearnu-energiju-4477233) in March. He said that a working group had already been established to analyse options such as extending the lifespan of the Krško nuclear power plant, [building additional capacity, and developing small modular reactors.](https://mingo.gov.hr/vijesti/ministar-susnjar-nuklearna-energija-vazna-je-za-gospodarski-razvoj-geopoliticku-stabilnost-i-postizanje-ugljicne-neutralnosti-eu/9961) Šušnjar placed particular emphasis on the [future interconnection of the Croatian and Italian electricity grids](https://balkangreenenergynews.com/susnjar-croatia-italy-mull-subsea-power-cable/), announcing that the two countries are considering the possibility of laying an undersea power cable linking Dalmatia with the Italian coast. He noted that [technical blueprints for the project](https://seenews.com/news/croatia-italy-mulling-subsea-electricity-link-minister-1272822) already exist.

The latest from Croatia - last month in recap
**Government measures keep energy prices stable -** The [Croatian government passed its 8th package](https://glashrvatske.hrt.hr/en/politics/government-adopts-its-8th-package-of-market-interventions-to-combat-inflation-12079264) to help citizens and the economy deal with rampant inflationat the end of March, allocating almost 300 million euros for various measures. Steps related to energy prices alone are worth 140 million euros, and will remain in force until the end of September. [Prime minister Andrej Plenković said](https://seenews.com/news/croatia-approves-296-mln-euro-energy-relief-package-1272896) that prices for electricity, gas and thermal energy for households, small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as public institutions, will remain unchanged thanks to the subsidies.
**Croatia’s[geothermal energy](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_g#geothermal_energy) potential - **The potential of [geothermal energy](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_g#geothermal_energy) was discussed in March at the [“Geothermal Investment Forum Croatia”](https://www.gifc.hr/) conference. On that occasion, [prime minister Andrej Plenković said](https://vlada.gov.hr/vijesti/izuzetan-geotermalni-potencijal-pozicionira-hrvatsku-na-energetskoj-karti-europe/43928) that “Croatia has the opportunity to harness its geothermal potential to become a key player in the regional energy system”. According to the [Croatian Hydrocarbon Agency](https://www.azu.hr/), there are currently [12 exploitation fields and 24 exploration areas](https://www.azu.hr/media/l3obgdbn/plan-razvoja-geotermalnog-potencijala-republike-hrvatske_final_1.pdf) for geothermal waters in Croatia, with ongoing research and drilling at several locations.
**Croatia still lags in solar energy use, grid projects face delays -** Despite its significant solar power potential, Croatia still imports 25 percent of its electricity during the summer months and ranks at the bottom of the EU in terms of solar energy use, renewables association [RES Croatia](https://oie.hr/en/) told the [Solar Flex Croatia 2025](https://www.solarpowereurope.org/events/solar-flex-croatia-2025) conference in March. The group’s director Maja Pokrovac said [that projects which have been waiting for three years](https://vijesti.hrt.hr/gospodarstvo/konferencija-solar-flex-kako-hrvatska-moze-postati-lider-zelene-tranzicije-12055902) for a decision from the [Croatian Energy Regulatory Agency (HERA)](https://www.hera.hr/en/html/index.html) regarding connection costs to the grid must be unblocked. Lahorko Wagmann, Director of the Energy Sector at HERA, said he [expects progress to be made](https://novac.jutarnji.hr/novac/aktualno/u-hrvatskoj-je-61-posto-prijenosne-mreze-zastarjelo-i-treba-zamjenu-15562475?cx_linkref=jl_home_najnovije) in the coming weeks. He said one of the main obstacles stopping Croatia from realising its solar potential was the lengthy process of building and modernizing the grid, noting that around 60 percent of the country’s transmission capacity is outdated.

Katarina's picks - reading recommendations & events
**Report on gender gap in Croatia’s energy sector.** As part of the EUWES project – Empowering Underrepresented Women in the Energy Sector – a document titled ["Mapping National Gender Equality Policies in the Energy Sector – The Case of Croatia"](https://euwes.door.hr/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2024/03/D1.2-Mapiranje-nacionalnih-politika-rodne-ravnopravnosti-u-energetskom-sektoru-Hrvatska.pdf) was published. The document is the result of research conducted between December 2023 and January 2024. The mapping highlighted a significant underrepresentation of women compared to men in energy sector jobs in Croatia, regardless of whether they are in the public or private sector. As a result, the EUWES project has also developed [Policy Recommendations](https://euwes.door.hr/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2024/12/Policy-Brief-HR.pdf) to address this issue. These include introducing career development programs for women in the energy sector, promoting equal opportunities for girls and women in STEM fields, and establishing a system for monitoring and reporting on gender representation, pay, and career advancement in both the public and private sectors.
**Registration open for Croatia's 2025 “Renewable Energy Days Conference”**[Registration is now open](https://oie.hr/dani-oie-2025-otvorene-prijave/) for the conference dedicated to renewable energy in Croatia, [Renewable Energy Days 2025](https://oie.hr/en/days-of-renewable-energy-sources-open-registrations-2/), which will take place from 21 to 23 May in Split. The conference will bring together key stakeholders from the renewable energy sector, identify the main challenges and regulatory and administrative obstacles, and offer concrete solutions, according to the organiser, renewables association [RES Croatia](https://oie.hr/en/).

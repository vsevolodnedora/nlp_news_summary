NGO Environmental Action Germany ([DUH](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/duh-environmental-action-germany)) has won separate greenwashing lawsuits [against airline Lufthansa](https://www.duh.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/pressemitteilung/deutsche-umwelthilfe-gewinnt-klimaklage-gegen-lufthansa-werbung-mit-vermeintlichem-co2-ausgleich-un/) and [apparel company Adidas](https://www.duh.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/pressemitteilung/rechtswidriges-zukunftsversprechen-zu-klimaneutralitaet-deutsche-umwelthilfe-gewinnt-klimaklage-gege/) on the grounds of misleading consumers with sustainability claims.
In the case against Lufthansa, the regional court in Cologne found that consumers choosing the "offset flight" option were left in the dark as to the extent of the airline's climate compensation and in relation to the specifically booked flight. Additionally, it remained unclear what exactly was to be offset and to what extent, and that the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) gave the impression that their contribution relates to their flight.
"The court confirms our criticism and addresses how one of the world's largest airlines systematically deceives customers and pretends that air travel is climate-neutral in exchange for additional fees," said [DUH](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/duh-environmental-action-germany) head Jürgen Resch. "Air travel is one of the most serious ways of harming the climate. Selling a clear conscience in return for indulgences is therefore particularly reprehensible."
The NGO had accused Lufthansa of using a compensation model that only accounted for a fraction of air traffic's climate impacts. Resch said Lufthansa should abandon domestic flights in Germany and instead go back to offering train tickets if the company was serious about reducing emissions.
In the case against Adidas, the Nuremberg-Fürth Regional Court [ordered the company](https://www.justiz.bayern.de/gerichte-und-behoerden/oberlandesgerichte/nuernberg/presse/2025/14.php) to no longer advertise the statement that it will be climate neutral by 2050, as there were no concrete steps on how this goal would be achieved beyond 2030. "Advertising a company or its products with an alleged climate neutrality can have a significant impact on purchase decisions," [DUH](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/duh-environmental-action-germany) quoted from the judgement.
"Adidas' defeat in court underlines the importance of clear and transparent promises for the future," Resch said. The NGO called on the incoming German government to establish clear rules and impose fines for consumer deception. The EU has [taken steps to regulate green claims](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/qa-how-eu-aims-reign-false-green-claims-products). Both verdicts are not final.

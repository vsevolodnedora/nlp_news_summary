# Germany aims for leading role in battery and nuclear fusion technology – media report
## 
n-tv
Germany's research ministry aims to make the country a leader in battery [storage](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_s#storage) innovation and manufacturing, nuclear fusion and geothermal technology, as well as microchip production, n-tv [reported](https://www.n-tv.de/wirtschaft/Bund-will-Deutschland-zum-Chip-Eldorado-machen-article25904243.html). In an unpublished draft of its "high-tech agenda" seen by n-tv, which is set to be approved by the government in July, the ministry said it will present a long-term action plan by the end of the year to sketch the path to the world’s first [nuclear fusion reactor](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/in-brief-fusion).
Despite decades of research, nuclear fusion remains in the experimental stage, and commercial use of nuclear fusion [is likely decades away](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/qa-nuclear-fusion). But recent research successes have stoked optimism in the sector, which is now also driven by private start-ups in addition to public research projects. The parties forming Germany’s government had already agreed [in their coalition treaty](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/what-germanys-aspiring-coalition-government-agreement-means-climate-and-energy) to build the world’s first fusion reactor in the country.
The paper says Germany should also become the world leader in geothermal technology. From 2026, "competence clusters" for battery materials and production are to be established. Moreover, Germany should aim for technological leadership in hydrogen energy, as well as in next-generation wind and solar technologies, the ministry said, adding that the global market for green energy technologies is expected to grow from 700 million dollars in 2023 to more than 2 billion dollars in 2035.
The strategy draft says that at least three manufacturing sites for smart and energy-efficient chips should be built in Germany. Microchips are needed for technologies such as wind turbines, solar panels or electric vehicles, while [storage](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_s#storage) is key for an electricity system based on fluctuating renewable sources.
"Germany is still a technology leader in many climate protection technologies and must remain so," said Simone Peter, head of renewable energy association [BEE](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bee-german-renewable-energy-federation). Germany's previous government had [tried to attract](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/nationalism-threat-energy-transition-investments-says-scholz-chip-plant-construction-start) chip production into the country too, but [faced setbacks](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/plans-multi-billion-euro-chip-plant-evs-brink-collapse-media-reports) when projects were provisionally halted in Magdeburg and Saarland.

Over half of the German environment ministry’s ([BMUKN](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bmukn-federal-ministry-environment-climate-action-nature-conservation-and-nuclear-safety)) budget for 2025 will be spent on managing the country’s nuclear waste and preparing a decision for a final nuclear repository. According to a government budget draft, the ministry led by Social Democrat ([SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party)) Carsten Schneider will receive 2.7 billion euros this year, about 300 million euros more than in 2024. Out of this sum, 1.4 billion euros are reserved for the “temporary and final [storage](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_s#storage) of radioactive waste,” a [parliament report](https://www.bundestag.de/presse/hib/kurzmeldungen-1097626) on the draft said.
In 2024, Germany spent about 1.1 billion euros on nuclear waste management, after the country shuttered its last commercial nuclear power plants in mid-2023. Some 860 million euros from the 2025 ministry budget will be spent on the search for a final repository and about 535 million euros on temporary [storage](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_s#storage).
By contrast, about 460 million euros were marked for nature and environment protection measures by the ministry, while the subordinate Federal Environment Agency ([UBA](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/uba-federal-environment-agency)) will receive another 205 million euros. Climate action costs were not yet reflected in the budget, as the environment ministry was handed responsibility for this policy field from the economy ministry only in spring this year, the parliament report said. It did not specify which measures are covered under this field. Energy policy remains with the economy ministry.
“Nuclear waste is eating up environmental protection,” Wolfgang Ehmke from the citizen initiative for environmental protection of Lüchow-Dannenberg, [told](https://taz.de/Budget-des-Umweltministeriums/!6102402/) newspaper Tageszeitung (taz). The rural district in northern Germany is known for its temporary nuclear repository in the municipality of Gorleben, which has been the site of many anti-nuclear protests over the past decades. Management and construction works at the Gorleben repository alone climbed from 20 million euros in 2024 to 33 million one year later, the newspaper said.
Another repository, Asse near the town of Wolfenbüttel, would even require maintenance investments of 206 million euros this year. Costs for managing the country’s nuclear waste are even higher, as part of the legacy costs are carried by other ministries. For example, the research ministry is responsible for research reactors, while the finance ministry handles nuclear infrastructure in the former eastern German states, as agreed in the country’s reunification treaties, taz added.
Part of the costs of Germany’s nuclear waste management are financed through a fund filled by the former nuclear plant operators. These made a one-off payment of 24 billion euros in 2017 and were subsequently freed of further financial liabilities. Following Germany’s 2011 renewed commitment to [phase out nuclear power](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/dossiers/history-energiewende), the country started looking for a location to safely store its roughly 28,100 cubic metres of radioactive material [for hundreds of thousands of years](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/what-do-nuclear-waste-storage-question). Initially, the aim was to select a location for the final repository by 2031 but, in 2022, the responsible agency pushed the deadline to until at least 2046.

People in Germany's cities are completing more journeys by bicycle or foot, while the dominance of cars is decreasing, the latest ['Mobility in Germany](https://bmdv.bund.de/SharedDocs/DE/Artikel/G/mobilitaet-in-deutschland.html)' report commissioned by the transport ministry showed. In mid-2023 to mid-2024, close to a third (31%) of journeys were completed by foot in major cities, compared to 27 percent in 2017, the representative assessment of everyday mobility in Germany showed. Journeys made by car had a share of 33 percent.
Green mobility association VCD [said](https://www.vcd.org/service/presse/pressemitteilungen/neue-erhebung-mobilitaet-in-deutschland-zeigt-positiven-trend-mehr-rad-und-oepnv-weniger-auto-vcd-fordert-von-politik-neue-prioritaeten) the report showed positive trends in mobility. "Germans are driving less than in 2017. This is particularly noticeable in cities," said transport policy spokesperson Michael Müller-Görnert. "In Hamburg and Berlin, for example, car traffic has been declining for years, while walking, cycling, and riding buses and trains are all on the rise.”
Across the country, walking saw the biggest growth, accounting for 26 percent of journeys (up from 22% in 2017). Public transport use also saw a boost since the introduction of the monthly Germany-wide local public transport ticket (Deutschlandticket), the report found. Additionally, Germany's bicycle fleet has grown from 75 million units in 2017 to 81 million in 2023, with a quarter of them being e-bikes.
For context, the country's car fleet stands at around 50 million vehicles, accounting for around 1.2 per household. "In rural areas, the car remains indispensable for almost all road users," the report reads. Over 90 percent of households outside of cities report owning at least one car.
Over 218,000 households and around 420,000 people were surveyed between April 2023 and July 2024 about their everyday transport behaviour for the report, which was previously carried out in 2002, 2008 and 2017. The results are intended to aid politicians and administrators in making transport policy decisions.
The VCD called on the federal and state governments "to realign their priorities in transport and infrastructure planning," arguing that priority should be given to the expansion of bus and rail services, as well as to the construction of safe cycling infrastructure.
A recent report by [Greenpeace](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/greenpeace-germany) found that over a quarter of people in Germany [lack adequate access](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/quarter-germans-lack-adequate-access-public-transportation-report) to public transport. All the while, a third of people say they [do not feel well connected](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/one-three-people-germany-dissatisfied-local-public-transport-survey) by bus or train near their home, and are not satisfied with the number of departures at their nearest stop, according to a joint survey by environmental associations. Still, regional train travel [has increased significantly](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/regional-train-travel-increases-nearly-third-introduction-germany-wide-public-transport-ticket) since the introduction of the Deutschlandticket.

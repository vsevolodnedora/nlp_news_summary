Germany's new economy and energy minister, Katherina Reiche from chancellor Friedrich Merz's conservative Christian Democrats ([CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)), has ruled out the country's return to conventional nuclear power plants. "The phase-out has been completed. A return to nuclear power requires not only money, but also the trust of the companies that are supposed to make this commitment, and not just for one legislative period, but beyond," Reiche [said](https://youtu.be/PvkvKNXfe0c?feature=shared&t=400).
"If I have understood the sector in which I used to work correctly, there is a great deal of scepticism that a positive decision could be permanent. I don't see companies investing on their own initiative," the former energy manager said. "It is also still difficult to achieve a social consensus in favour of this. We could have had it, namely to significantly extend the operating life of the last three nuclear power plants during the energy crisis. This opportunity was missed. We now have to live with the situation."
In their coalition agreement, Reiche's conservatives and the Social Democrats ([SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party)) did not mention a return to nuclear power, indicating that the new government had no intention of doing so. During the election campaign, various conservatives had called for reversing the phaseout. Instead, the agreement said that the new government wanted to establish the first nuclear fusion reactor in Germany. Reiche also said that new generation small modular reactors are another matter.
The Greens welcomed Reiche’s statement on nuclear, but criticised her plans to monitor and possibly throttle the country’s renewable power source expansion, [reports](https://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/deutschland/bundesregierung-gruene-warnen-ministerin-vor-zoegern-bei-erneuerbaren/100127537.html) news agency dpa in an article published by newspaper Handelsblatt. A slower roll-out of renewables would mean higher costs “in terms of becoming subject to blackmailing by autocratic states, rising CO2 prices and climate damage costs,” argued the Greens’ parliamentary group co-leader, Julia Verlinden. She also said power generation costs for renewables are much lower than those for fossil-based power plants. 
In her inaugural address in the ministry, Reiche said that Germany needed [a “reality check” to assess the costs and risks of renewables](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/germanys-new-energy-minister-calls-reality-check-costs-and-risks-renewables). Expansion thus should possibly be curtailed to keep it better aligned with the slow buildout of the country’s power grid. Continuing the policy of her [Green Party](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/green-party) predecessor Robert Habeck, Reiche also said that the country quickly needs to implement auctions for building up to 20 GW of new gas-fired power plant capacity to provide the country with an effective backup reserve for times of very little power output by renewables.

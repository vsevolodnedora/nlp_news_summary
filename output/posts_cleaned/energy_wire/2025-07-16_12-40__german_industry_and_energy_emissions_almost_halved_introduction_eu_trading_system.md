Emissions from Germany's industry and energy sectors have almost halved since the introduction of the European Emissions Trading System ([EU ETS](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_e#eu_ets)) 20 years ago, the Federal Environment Agency ([UBA](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/uba-federal-environment-agency)) [said](https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/20-jahre-europaeischer-emissionshandel-deutsche). Germany saw a 47 percent drop in emissions from energy-intensive industries and the energy sector. Across Europe, [ETS](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_e#ets) emissions have fallen by 51 percent during the same period.
"Since its introduction, [emissions trading](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_e#emissions_trading) has gradually developed into the central climate protection instrument in Germany and Europe," said [UBA](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/uba-federal-environment-agency) head Dirk Messner. The energy sector has driven the emissions decline in Germany, cutting [greenhouse gases](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_g#greenhouse_gases) by 54 percent since 2005. [UBA](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/uba-federal-environment-agency) attributes this recent progress to the growing share of renewable energies, the decline in electricity generation from coal and [lignite](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_l#lignite), and the increase in net electricity imports from other countries.
"Embedded in an effective mix of instruments, [emissions trading](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_e#emissions_trading) will make a significant contribution to achieving the legal climate targets of Germany and the EU," said Daniel Klingenfeld, who heads the [emissions trading](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_e#emissions_trading) authority division at [UBA](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/uba-federal-environment-agency).
The [ETS](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_e#ets) [is a market mechanism](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/understanding-european-unions-emissions-trading-system) that puts a price on CO2 emissions, thus creating an incentive to reduce them. Companies must buy or receive allowances corresponding to their CO2 emissions, which makes the burning of fossil fuels more expensive. The EU sets a cap on how much CO2 can be emitted, and reduces the maximum amount each year. Emissions from inter-European air transport and maritime transport were added to the [ETS](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_e#ets) in 2012 and 2024 respectively. A reformed [ETS](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_e#ets) 2 is also set to cover the entire heating and transport sector by 2027.
Around 85 percent of German emissions are covered by carbon pricing systems â€“ the [EU ETS](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_e#eu_ets) and [Germany's national carbon price](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/germanys-planned-carbon-pricing-system-transport-and-buildings), which currently already covers emissions from heating and transport. The [proceeds from the levy](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/emissions-trading-generates-185-billion-euros-revenue-germany-2024-uba) are the main source of funding for the [special "climate and transformation fund"](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/qa-what-german-top-courts-debt-brake-ruling-means-climate-policy), which is used to finance energy transition projects.
Germany is at risk of missing emission-cutting targets with the new coalition government's [climate policy plans](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/what-germanys-aspiring-coalition-government-agreement-means-climate-and-energy), the country's key climate advisors [said](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/germany-runs-risk-missing-emission-cutting-targets-new-government-plans-climate-council).

# Germans say energy transition costs not fairly distributed, lack trust in key actors – survey
Most Germans say that the country’s landmark energy transition is not implemented in a socially just way as the burdens are not fairly distributed (63%), and they have little trust in politicians handling the shift properly, [a survey](https://wupperinst.org/fileadmin/redaktion/downloads/publications/WP205_Akzeptanz_Energiewende.pdf) overseen by the [Wuppertal Institute](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/wuppertal-institute-climate-environment-and-energy) has shown. More than 53 percent of respondents said they doubt that federal policymakers say or do “the right thing” when it comes to the energy transition.
Only a fifth said the goals and measures of the energy transition are understandable and transparent, according to the results. At the same time, almost 50 percent of respondents said they knew “nothing” or “almost nothing” about the energy transition.
More than 70 percent of respondents see climate change as a threat, and 60 percent said that the energy transition is important in the long run. Overall, respondents see inflation/poverty/social justice as the greatest political challenge, with climate in 4th and the energy transition coming in 6th place.
Peoples’ lack of trust in stakeholders and their perception of economic injustice threaten the vital support needed for the energy transition, the authors warned. They added the lack of understanding also posed a challenge for policymakers, who need to translate abstract political goals into concrete measures. With the increase of energy prices, the [affordability of the energy transition](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/vote25-analysis-germany-buildings-heating-transition-next-german-government) in people's homes is set to take centre stage for the next German government. The parties are often presenting very [different positions on energy and climate policy](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/german-parties-energy-and-climate-policy-positions-2025-general-election) for the upcoming election.

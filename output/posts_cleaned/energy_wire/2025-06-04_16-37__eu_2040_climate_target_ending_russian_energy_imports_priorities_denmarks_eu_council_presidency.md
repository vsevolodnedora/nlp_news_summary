The Danish government intends to use its EU Council presidency in the second half of this year to prioritise reaching an agreement among member states on a 2040 climate target for the European Union, said climate and energy minister Lars Aagaard at the annual summit of the energy industry association Eurelectric in Brussels. Also speaking at the conference, the European Commission’s top energy official Ditte Juul Jørgensen announced that her institution would very soon present legislative proposals aimed at ending imports of gas and nuclear energy from Russia – another priority for the Danish Council presidency. The official said that the EU would still need fossil molecules for the coming decades. [UPDATES to include quotes by Jørgensen]
Grid infrastructure plans, [a climate target for 2040](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/qa-eu-propose-2040-emissions-reduction-target), and details on the EU's move to end its dependence on Russian energy imports are key priorities for the Danish government as it takes over the 6-month presidency of the EU Council in July, said Lars Aagaard, the country’s minister for climate and energy.
"We will have to deal with three very important issues, and the biggest one will probably be to set the 2040 climate target," said Aagaard at the Eurelectric Power Summit 2025 in Brussels. Denmark would advocate for a target to reduce [greenhouse gas](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_g#greenhouse_gas) emissions by at least 90 percent compared to 1990 levels. While other countries had "another view", he said that his government’s goal is to "finalise the political discussions" on the target. "As a presidency you play with the cards that you have been given, and within a very short timeframe we will do the outmost to come to a conclusion on what the 2040 target should be," he said.
In addition, the presidency would also focus on electricity infrastructure and "advance as much as we can" the forthcoming package on grids, which the European Commission plans to present before the end of the year to reform laws to speed up network expansion.
The European Commission is set to present a legislative proposal to amend the union's climate law and set a new climate target for 2040 [on 2 July](https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/documents-register/api/files/SEC\(2025\)2528?ersIds=090166e51d8910d4). The presentation has been delayed due to lack of support from EU member states. Politico recently [reported](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-climate-chief-wopke-hoekstra-germany-2040-climate-target-carbon-credits/) that Wopke Hoekstra, the EU executive’s climate commissioner, had lobbied with the new German government during coalition talks to support the target, but under the condition that emissions reduction projects in third countries could be counted towards the EU target.
In 2024, the Commission [already recommended](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/eu-sets-focus-climate-friendly-industry-2040-climate-target-proposal) that the EU aim to reduce net [greenhouse gas](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_g#greenhouse_gas) emissions by 90 percent by 2040. It will now follow up with a legislative proposal that must then be negotiated among member states and with the European Parliament. The union has set the target to become climate neutral by 2050.

“Freedom Bill” – Commission to present legal drafts to help end Russian energy imports “in the very near future” 
The EU Council represents the executive governments of member states, and the presidency rotates among EU member states every six months. It is not only responsible for setting policy priorities and planning and chairing meetings among ministers and heads of government, but must also try and reach agreement on laws with the EU’s other legislative bodies – the Commission and the Parliament.
Minister Aargaard said that another priority would be to "pursue a successful outcome" of what he called the "Freedom Bill". This concerns the [EU’s plan to end the dependence on imports of Russian fossil fuels](https://commission.europa.eu/news/roadmap-fully-end-eu-dependency-russian-energy-2025-05-06_en). The Commission had recently presented its road map, but it still has to be fleshed out through corresponding legislation. Countries which still heavily depend on these imports, such as Hungary, have been reluctant to agree to the plans.
"We are working on the legal proposals to follow up on the Commission’s roadmap to end any imports of Russian energy, and we’ll be presenting them in the very near future, both on gas and nuclear," Ditte Juul Jørgensen, director general for energy at the European Commission, told the audience in Brussels.

Need fossil fuels for decades – Commission official 
The official also emphasised that fossil fuels would play a role in the European energy system for some time.
"We are still going to need molecules – and fossil molecules – in our system for the coming decades. It is a reality," she said. "The demand is hopefully going to be reduced as fast and as much as possible," she said, adding that the EU had to make sure not to have too little fossil fuels, "because that would increase pressure on prices."
The European Union [relies heavily on fossil fuel imports](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/germanys-dependence-imported-fossil-fuels) from around the globe, and homegrown renewable electricity is [considered vital for ensuring future energy security](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/eu-uk-vow-energy-security-cooperation-home-grown-clean-sources-heart). Since the start of Russia's war in Ukraine in 2022, the EU has drastically reduced energy imports from Russia through its own efforts and Russia's decision to halt pipeline gas supply.
Ditte Juul Jørgensen also said that the Commission is currently reviewing the security of supply framework across the European Union and would be making new proposals.

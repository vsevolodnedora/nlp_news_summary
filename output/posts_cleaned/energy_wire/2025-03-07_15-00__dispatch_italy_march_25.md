# Dispatch from Italy | March ‘25
Winter may finally be on the way out but Italy is still grappling with high electricity prices, with average wholesale prices in February among the highest in Europe. Under increasing pressure to halt further rises, the government approved measures to reduce power bills. Meanwhile, Giorgia Meloni’s ruling party has also advanced plans for nuclear energy, with a new law paving the way for regulations on reactors. The country is also pushing forward with the Southern Hydrogen Corridor, a project aimed at linking North Africa to Europe, despite persistent concerns about its sustainability credentials. Additionally, the use of EU emission trading revenues has raised questions as only a small portion has been allocated to climate action.

# Only one in five trees in German forests are healthy – govt report

Clean Energy Wire
The majority of trees in German forests show an amount of crown thinning that implies they’re unhealthy, with only 21 percent of examined trees unaffected, found [a survey](https://www.bmel.de/DE/themen/wald/wald-in-deutschland/waldzustandserhebung.html) by the agriculture ministry ([BMLEH](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bmleh-federal-ministry-agriculture-food-and-community)). Around 43 percent of the trees in the sample survey have a small amount of thinning and 36 percent show “significant” thinning.
The results of the survey have not changed much in comparison to [the previous year](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/german-forests-needed-climate-action-remain-poor-condition-report) despite relatively favourable weather conditions over the last two years, indicating that forests have still not recovered from the dry and hot summers between 2018 and 2020, said the ministry. Aside from weather conditions, other factors that can impact trees include the age and disposition of individual trees, current and previous management, harmful organisms and the input of air pollutants.
Forests, which make up one third of Germany’s land area, are an important carbon sink. Living trees in Germany currently store around 108 tonnes of carbon per hectare, with further carbon stored in dead wood and soil, said the ministry. Strengthening natural carbon sinks, including forests, is part of the German government’s efforts to reduce [greenhouse gas](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_g#greenhouse_gas) emissions.
[In recent years](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/german-forests-massively-damaged-due-droughts-heat-waves-2020-report), however, German forests have been [damaged heavily by droughts](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/recurring-droughts-will-change-german-forests-forever-researcher), bark beetle infestations, storms and forest fires. Forests in Germany [have become net emitters](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/germanys-forests-no-longer-carbon-sink-now-net-emitters-report) of carbon dioxide.

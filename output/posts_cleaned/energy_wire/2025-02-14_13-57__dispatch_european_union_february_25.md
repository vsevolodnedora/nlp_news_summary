# Dispatch from the European Union | February '25
Administrative "simplification" will be a key focus of the European Commission's [2025 work programme](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/strategy-documents/commission-work-programme/commission-work-programme-2025_en), trade and economic security commissioner [Maroš Šefčovič told MEPs](https://multimedia.europarl.europa.eu/en/video/commission-work-programme-2025-opening-statement-by-maros-sefcovic-european-commissioner-for-trade-and-economic-security-and-european-commissioner-for-interinstitutional-relations-and-transparency_I266747) during the European Parliament’s plenary session in Strasbourg. This effort to reduce the administrative burden on companies is to start with three so-called omnibus packages, which will address core aspects of the bloc's Green Deal. "This work programme sets the political tone for the next five years," Šefčovič emphasised, reaffirming that the objectives of the Green Deal remain unchanged, referring to the EU 2050 climate neutrality target. "The goal is to enhance the competitiveness of the European economy while continuing to decarbonise its industries," he added.

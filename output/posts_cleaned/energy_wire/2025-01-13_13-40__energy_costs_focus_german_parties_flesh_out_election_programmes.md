# Energy costs in focus as German parties flesh out election programmes
## 
Clean Energy Wire / Tagesspiegel Background
With just six weeks to go before Germany’s parliamentary elections in late February, several parties have specified their ideas on how to ease the burden of energy costs on households and companies. The conservatives ([CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)) under Friedrich Merz, who looks likely to become the country’s next chancellor [according to current polls](https://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/), adopted an “[Agenda 2030](https://www.cdu.de/aktuelles/funktionierender-staat/cdu-beschliesst-agenda-2030/)” that promises to reduce the price of electricity by “at least” five cents per kilowatt-hour, by lowering taxes and reducing [grid fees](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_g#grid_fees). Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democrats ([SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party)) also officially adopted their [party manifesto](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/german-parties-energy-and-climate-policy-positions-2025-general-election), which focuses on increasing investments and social justice, and proposes to halve [grid fees](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_g#grid_fees).
Lower energy prices, as well as tax cuts worth billions, are part of the CDU’s plan to boost economic growth to “at least two percent”. The paper also calls for abolishing the EU 2035 phase-out date for combustion engines, and argues that synthetic fuels will enable these engines “to contribute to achieving climate targets”. [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union) member Christoph Ahlhaus, who chairs the country’s association of small and medium-sized enterprises, told public broadcaster ARD that unresolved financing of the party concept was “indeed the weak point”, reported newsletter Tagesspiegel Background.
In addition to [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union) and [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party), the populist far-right Alternative für Deutschland ([AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany)), as well as the Bündnis Sarah Wagenknecht ([BSW](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bsw-sahra-wagenknecht-alliance)), a populist left anti-immigrant outfit, also detailed or added to their election promises. [AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) leader Alice Weidel said the party wanted to tear down all of Germany’s wind turbines. Meanwhile, the [BSW](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bsw-sahra-wagenknecht-alliance) plans to resume large-scale gas imports from Russia.
According to [the latest polls](https://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/), the [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union) can expect to receive around 30 percent of the vote at the 23 February elections. The [AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) is currently polling around 20 percent, [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) and Greens both at around 15 percent, while the [BSW](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bsw-sahra-wagenknecht-alliance) hovers around five percent, the threshold to enter parliament.

Thousands of scientists from a broad section of fields have come together to urge Germany's next government to prioritise climate policy. "We are very concerned," reads [an open letter](https://www.bayceer.uni-bayreuth.de/s4f/de/top/o2/stat.php) to politicians of the future German governing parties, signed by over 7,200 scientists and scholars.
"The climate crisis and other environmental crises (loss of biodiversity, depletion of biogeochemical cycles, etc.) are the greatest medium-term threat to security, the economy and prosperity, democracy, civilisation and human life. Nevertheless, these issues played almost no role in the German federal election campaign," they wrote, adding that [recent escalations in foreign policy](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/vote25-next-german-government-must-shape-unified-eu-response-trump-shakes-global-order) threatened to sideline the issue further.
The scientists called for Germany's next government to clearly commit itself to the country's [climate action law](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/germanys-climate-action-law-begins-take-shape) and the [European Green Deal](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en); to communicate transparently and constructively about challenges - such as the required changes in all areas of life - with the population; to base policy decisions on scientific facts and set clear climate policy; and to accompany climate protection measures with tangible social protection components.
Signatories ranged from scientists at research institutes and universities, to others at large steel and chemicals companies. Germany will [get a new government soon](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/dossiers/germany-coalition-government-talks-vote-2025), following snap elections on 23 February. While the likely future coalition parties remain committed to the country's climate targets, they are [set to place a narrower focus](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/conservative-german-election-winner-merz-seeks-coalition-spd-greens-sidelined) on climate policies compared to the outgoing government.
Climate change is causing Europe to [warm faster than anywhere else](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/qa-why-europe-needs-adapt-impacts-climate-change) in the world. Temperatures in the continent have increased at [more than twice](https://public.wmo.int/en/our-mandate/climate/wmo-statement-state-of-global-climate/Europe) the global average over the past 30 years. In addition to heatwaves, climate change is also causing many other extreme weather events to become more frequent and more severe. Their consequences cascade and threaten other issues, including economic recovery or [security](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/climate-change-gravest-threat-german-and-european-security-government-report).

# Dispatch from Italy | April ‘25
The return of nuclear energy in Italy is slowly but steadily shifting from possibility to concrete political project. The transition to renewables, meanwhile, has entered a paradoxical phase: installation numbers are solid yet local communities are increasingly opposing new developments. While all this is going on, the Meloni government is becoming more openly critical of the Green Deal, particularly in defence of the Italian automotive industry, despite new data suggesting that the main threat to the sector is actually a transition that is too slow and uncertain.

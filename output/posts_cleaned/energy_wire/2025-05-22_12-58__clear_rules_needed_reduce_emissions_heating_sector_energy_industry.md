# Clear rules needed to reduce emissions in heating sector – energy industry
## 
Clean Energy Wire
The German government must quickly provide clarity on how it plans to cut emissions in the heating sector and create reliable framework conditions, a host of energy industry associations [said in a joint appeal](https://www.bdew.de/presse/waermewende-waermeappell/). The government's plans to "abolish the heating law", as stated in the coalition agreement, had caused "considerable uncertainty" among citizens and businesses, the group – which includes energy industry association [BDEW](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bdew-german-association-energy-and-water-industries), utilities association [VKU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/vku-german-association-local-utilities), renewables association [BEE](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bee-german-renewable-energy-federation), and heat pump association BWP – said.
Germany's Building Energy Act, part of which is known as the heating law, spells out the gradual phase out of oil and gas boilers, which still dominate the market and are [installed in 79 percent](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/four-five-residential-buildings-germany-still-heated-oil-and-gas-energy-agency) of Germany's residential buildings. Its introduction [was subject to fierce debate](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/qa-germany-debates-phaseout-fossil-fuel-heating-systems) as it was accompanied by multiple waves of campaigns spreading public worries and lacked details on how the government would support households in the transition.
Germany's new coalition government between the conservative [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) alliance and the Social Democratic Party ([SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party)) [pledged to abolish the law](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/what-germanys-aspiring-coalition-government-agreement-means-climate-and-energy) to make it "open to any technology, more flexible and simpler".
But the associations said clarification was needed as details on what this meant in concrete terms were sorely lacking. "In order to ensure a successful heat transition and strengthen the confidence of all those involved, it is urgently necessary to specify the objectives and measures in greater detail," they wrote in their joint appeal. "The heating transition needs clarity, reliability and a practical framework." They called for a long-term stable funding policy to secure confidence in the transition and trigger investment.
Germany's building sector is lagging in efforts to reduce emissions, largely because of dirty boilers. Making German homes less climate-damaging while keeping them affordable for residents will be a [central task](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/vote25-analysis-germany-buildings-heating-transition-next-german-government) for the country's new government.

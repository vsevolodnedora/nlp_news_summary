# Share of job offers in renewable sector increased despite economic crises – report

Clean Energy Wire
The proportion of advertised jobs related to the energy transition rose from 1.8 to 3.8 percent between 2019 and 2024 in Germany despite multiple economic crises during that time period, found [a report](https://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/de/publikationen/publikation/did/die-energiewende-als-jobmotor) by the German Economic Institute ([IW](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/german-economic-institute-iw)), commissioned by the Bertelsmann Foundation. While the total number of jobs fluctuated due to the coronavirus pandemic and economic crisis in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, adverts for energy transition jobs proved crisis-resistant, it said. Demand for employees to work on infrastructure like energy grids is growing slightly faster than for renewable energies. However, the construction of new wind and solar plants still make up most jobs in the sector.
One of the benefits of renewables is that they are decentralised, meaning all regions benefit as the jobs are spread throughout the country, [said](https://www.bee-ev.de/service/pressemitteilungen/beitrag/erneuerbaren-branche-bleibt-jobmotor) Wolfram Axthelm, managing director of renewable industry association [BEE](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bee-german-renewable-energy-federation). “From construction electronics and sales to research and development, there are opportunities for graduates, experienced professionals and, increasingly, career changers,” he said.
Companies are particularly looking for specialists in craft professions like construction electronics or heat and air conditioning. However, the report found there is a shortage of skilled workers, which could hinder the energy transition. To address shortages, employees are offering more lateral entry opportunities and providing training in-house.
Researchers [have previously highlighted](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/major-barriers-just-transition-workers-emission-intensive-industries-europe-researchers) that high salaries and a lack of similarly paid alternatives in energy transition industries is holding workers back from changing over. Demand for jobs in the [e-mobility](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_e#e-mobility) sector also dropped last year, more so than for companies [focused on](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/falling-job-vacancies-reflect-struggling-e-car-sector-germany-research-institute) combustion engines.

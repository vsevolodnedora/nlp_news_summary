# Onshore wind power continues dynamic growth in Germany in early 2025

Germany’s [onshore wind](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_o#onshore_wind) power capacity continued to grow apace in early 2025 after four gigawatts (GW) of new turbines were licensed in the first three months of the year, industry agency Fachagentur Wind und Solar has [said](https://www.fachagentur-wind-solar.de/veroeffentlichungen/mediathek/detail/ausbau-und-genehmigungsentwicklung-der-windenergie-an-land-im-1-quartal-2025). The first quarter of the year was the third quarter in a row in which more than four GW were licensed and the strongest January-to-March period ever, the agency added.
With 1.7 GW of newly licensed capacity, western state North Rhine-Westphalia topped the list once again, followed by northern wind power leader state Lower Saxony with 0.8 GW. “Despite the wealth of new licenses, the duration of licensing procedures has gone down again significantly,” the agency said, explaining that licenses this year so far took 20 percent less time on average to be obtained than in 2024.
At the same time, one GW of new turbines had been physically installed between the start of the year and the end of March – nearly 40 percent more than during the same period one year before. North Rhine-Westphalia led the field in this category as well, with 342 megawatts (MW) installed in 64 new turbines, followed by Lower Saxony (266 MW) and eastern state Brandenburg (148 MW). In total, the capacity of installed onshore turbines exceeded 64 GW in roughly 28,830 turbines by the end of March.

# Dispatch from the European Union | May '25
Three years on from the invasion of Ukraine, the European Union is still trying to wean itself off Russian energy supplies. The bloc has come a long way from the dependency it once had, yet certain EU countries still rely on Russia for other fossil fuels and nuclear fuel imports. The EU views this as a [security threat](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_1131) and has [tabled plans](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_1131) to rid its energy mix of Russian supplies completely. This will happen in an increasingly unstable geopolitical and trade environment: April saw the global trade landscape rocked by a series of tariffs unveiled by US president Donald Trump. While importing more US liquified natural gas is being seen as a[ potential way for the EU to avoid tariffs](https://www.ft.com/content/2d7c7a07-1232-4115-9dca-e99bb068c879), this is far from a guarantee and is raising concerns about a potential emissions lock-in and stranded assets.

Temperatures in Germany will this year be the hottest since records began for the third consecutive year, the country’s weather service [DWD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/dwd-germanys-national-meteorological-service) [said](https://social.bund.de/@DeutscherWetterdienst/113667653122665974). "Never since the end of the 19th century has it been as warm in Germany as in 2024," [DWD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/dwd-germanys-national-meteorological-service) board member Tobias Fuchs said. "The consequences of ever-increasing global warming will affect us with more frequent and more intense extreme weather events."
The year 2023 – at an average temperature of 10.6 degrees Celsius, 1.3°C higher than the reference period 1991 to 2020 – had [already been the warmest in Germany](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/2023-hottest-year-record-germany-meteorological-service) since records began in 1881. The previous year of 2022, meanwhile, [was tied with 2018 for the record](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/2022-sunniest-and-among-warmest-years-germany-meteorological-service-dwd). The meteorological service will publish its official report on the year's temperatures on 30 December.
This year is also set to be the warmest globally – beating 2023 – and the first where temperatures averaged more than 1.5°C compared to pre-industrial levels, EU climate change service Copernicus [reported](https://climate.copernicus.eu/copernicus-2024-virtually-certain-be-warmest-year-and-first-year-above-15degc). Globally, 2023 [was recognised as the hottest year](https://climate.copernicus.eu/copernicus-november-2023-remarkable-year-continues-warmest-boreal-autumn-2023-will-be-warmest-year) since the start of weather data collection.

Deutsche ReGas, the operator of Germany’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal on the island of Rügen, expects a much higher utilisation rate of the installation this year than in 2024, its first year of operation, news agency dpa reported in an [article](https://www.n-tv.de/regionales/mecklenburg-vorpommern/Deutsche-Regas-erwartet-hohe-Auslastung-ihres-LNG-Terminals-article25709415.html) published on news site ntv. “The demand for natural gas is currently high, also to refill the gas storages that are now about 30 percent full,” said Deutsche ReGas manager Ingo Wagner. One year ago, storages [were more than twice as full](https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/DE/Gasversorgung/aktuelle_gasversorgung/start.html), he added. One LNG cargo ship per week has landed at the terminal since the end of March, each time delivering about one terawatt hour of gas that is then fed into the national grid.
According to a separate [article](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/energie/energie-deshalb-sind-plaetze-an-lng-terminals-bis-jahresende-ausgebucht/100121926.html) in business daily Handelsblatt, Wagner said all landing slots at the terminal for 2025 had now been allotted to paying customers. Likewise, the LNG terminals in Brunsbüttel and Wilhelmshaven on the North Sea also sold all of their landing slots in the latest round, operator Deutsche Energy Terminal said.
The Deutsche ReGas terminal on the island in the Baltic Sea was built in response to Russia’s war on Ukraine and the resulting collapse of energy trading across much of Europe. The terminal located in the town of Mukran [was fiercely rejected](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/local-representatives-urge-halt-plans-lng-terminal-german-baltic-sea-island) by local interest groups as well as by environmental groups, who argued that the infrastructure is oversized and its location near a popular holiday resort was poorly chosen.

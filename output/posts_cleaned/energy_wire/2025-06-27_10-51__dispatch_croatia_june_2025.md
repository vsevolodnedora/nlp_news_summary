# Dispatch from Croatia | June 2025
Two rounds of local elections were held in Croatia but the green transition was almost entirely absent from the campaigns. However, the topic was taken up by both the European Commission and Greenpeace Croatia, who addressed it in their reports and highlighted the need for decisive political action, investments in transmission and distribution grids, the expansion of energy [storage](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_s#storage) systems, and the removal of administrative barriers. Despite playing little role in the elections, the green transition did make some important progress in May and June, including launching new initiatives and ratifying international agreements.

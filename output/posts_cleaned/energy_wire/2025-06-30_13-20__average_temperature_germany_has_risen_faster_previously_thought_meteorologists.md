# Average temperature in Germany has risen faster than previously thought – meteorologists

Temperatures in Germany have increased at a quicker rate than previously thought, researchers from the country’s meteorological service [DWD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/dwd-germanys-national-meteorological-service) have found. The rise since 1881, when measurements began, was previously believed to have been 1.9 degrees Celsius – but the DWD’s latest [climate status report](https://www.dwd.de/DE/leistungen/klimastatusbericht/publikationen/ksb_2024.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=5) found that temperatures had actually risen by 2.5 degrees on average.
The meteorologists had initially relied on a linear model that uses the average temperatures of previous decades to determine the warming rate. “But the climate system is not linear,” [DWD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/dwd-germanys-national-meteorological-service) researcher Andreas Walter told news agency dpa in an article published by newspaper Tagesspiegel.
Scientists in recent years have observed a disproportionate rise in temperatures, indicating that the linear model failed to account for accelerations in the warming rate, Walter said. The [DWD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/dwd-germanys-national-meteorological-service), therefore, had instead opted for the so-called Loess-procedure, which uses more data points that include short-term fluctuations in all directions for a better approximation of the curve’s trajectory. The [DWD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/dwd-germanys-national-meteorological-service) says this method will lead to better predictions about future temperature developments that can illustrate the effects of climate action measures more accurately. 
The threshold in the [Paris Climate Agreement](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_p#paris_climate_agreement) - limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees - was breached globally for the first time in 2024. However, it will only be [classified as a target miss](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/limiting-global-warming-15degc-has-factually-failed-german-scientists) if average temperatures exceed this threshold for several years.
Germany, like much of Europe, is going through its first major heatwave of 2025 and is already experiencing the [effects of a prolonged drought earlier in the year](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/heat-drought-low-water-levels-trigger-concerns-about-health-and-shipping-germany). Many states have issued water use restrictions. Authorities in the east, south and west of the country have restricted the use of public water from lakes, wells, and rivers, dpa [reported](https://www.tagesspiegel.de/gesellschaft/panorama/hitzewelle-und-trockenheit-immer-mehr-stadte-in-deutschland-verbieten-wasserentnahme-13935412.html) in a separate Tagesspiegel article.

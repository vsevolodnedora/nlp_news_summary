# German energy industry, NGO call on EU to retain green growth focus in upcoming 'omnibus package' 
## 
Clean Energy Wire
Expectations among industrial players and environmental NGOs are high for the EU’s highly anticipated [Clean Industrial Deal](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/qa-eu-aims-bolster-competitiveness-through-clean-industrial-deal#one), a follow-up to the European Green Deal that aims to build on the bloc’s work to transition to a sustainable economy and focus on strengthening industry and increasing its competitiveness. The European Commission plans to present the deal, part of an "Omnibus package", on 26 February.
Stressing the increasing international competition facing Europe’s energy-intensive industry and the concerns about deindustrialisation and migration of essential system-critical industries, energy industry association [BDEW](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bdew-german-association-energy-and-water-industries) [is calling for](https://www.bdew.de/media/documents/25-01-21_Clean_Industrial_Deal_BDEW-Positionspapier.pdf) a continuation of the Green Deal; a reduction of system costs and the enablement of innovations; an improvement in the investment framework for the energy transition; and a reduction of the burden on energy consumers.
"It makes a lot of sense for the EU Commission to think about climate protection and industrial policy together,” [said](https://www.bdew.de/presse/presseinformationen/investitionen-und-bezahlbare-energie-fuer-eine-wettbewerbsfaehige-industrie/) [BDEW](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bdew-german-association-energy-and-water-industries) head Kerstin Andreae. “In order to maintain the ambitious climate goals of the Green Deal, the Clean Industrial Deal must create efficient implementation strategies and investment incentives. At the same time, accelerating the expansion of renewable energy, energy infrastructure and [storage](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_s#storage) capacities is essential in order to keep energy prices stable in the long term and to strengthen the resilience of the EU.”
For [Germanwatch](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/germanwatch) policy director Christoph Bals, the “basic direction of the Clean Industrial Deal is correct: competitiveness and climate neutrality can only be achieved jointly for the EU. While the Commission is rightly focusing on the further expansion of renewable energy, grids and flexibility, “convincing approaches to financing and a clear statement that the targets of [emissions trading](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_e#emissions_trading) will remain unchanged are lacking”, [Bals said](https://www.germanwatch.org/de/93059). “It is also irritating that the Commission is considering concluding joint long-term contracts for gas supplies. This raises the question of whether it is giving in to Trump despite the lack of an energy policy necessity and thus jeopardizing the climate targets."
In a joint statement, the Belgian Hydrogen Council, the Netherland’s NLHydrogen and the German National Hydrogen Council outlined a five point plan that calls for animproved and flexible regulatory framework for clean hydrogen; development of a pan-European hydrogen infrastructure; tailored financial support schemes; development of lead markets for clean hydrogen; and utilisation of regional strengths to create global champions.

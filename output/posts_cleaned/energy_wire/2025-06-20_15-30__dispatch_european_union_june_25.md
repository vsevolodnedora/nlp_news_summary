# Dispatch from the European Union | June '25
The coming weeks will be decisive for the European Union’s climate trajectory, with several key milestones rapidly approaching. Central among these is the European Commission’s long-awaited proposal for the [EU’s 2040 emissions reduction target](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/qa-eu-propose-2040-emissions-reduction-target), due to be released on 2 July.

The Commission’s 2040 climate target will inform the bloc’s updated [Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/who-sets-targets-expert-qa-european-energy-and-climate-policy) to the [Paris Agreement](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_p#paris_agreement), a wider list of efforts to be made between 2025 and 2035, which must be submitted to the UNFCCC by September. Before submitting its NDC, however, the EU needs to make another closely linked decision on setting overarching [greenhouse gas](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_g#greenhouse_gas) reduction targets for 2035. All of these will build on the reduction goals already enshrined in the [European Climate Law](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/covering-eus-fit-55-package-climate-and-energy-laws) – 55 percent by 2030 compared to 1990, and net zero by 2050. The Commission has already indicated its intention to propose a 90 percent emissions cut by 2040, but crucial details still need to be worked out in the months ahead.
But the [European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change (ESABCC)](https://climate-advisory-board.europa.eu/reports-and-publications/scientific-advice-for-amending-the-european-climate-law-setting-climate-goals-to-strengthen-eu-strategic-priorities) has firmly warned against this approach and insists that the EU’s 90-95 percent emissions cut by 2040 should be achieved entirely through domestic reductions and removals. Jette Bredahl Jacobsen, vice-chair of the advisory board, said that “relying on international carbon credits would risk missing vital opportunities to modernise the EU’s economy, create quality jobs and reinforce Europe’s position in clean tech leadership.” She also noted that the technologies required to meet the target domestically already exist: "We need to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, and the necessary technologies are largely available."
However, delays in drafting these plans have raised concerns about whether all member states will meet the deadline. Without timely submission, countries risk losing access to the first tranche of funding, due for disbursement in 2026. After submission, the Commission will review the SCPs, request clarifications where necessary, and issue a decision within five months.   
An increasing number of national ministers [are calling](https://carbon-pulse.com/392444/) for a review of the EU ETS2, with the Polish presidency of the Council of the EU notably assertive on the matter. The European Commission[ ](https://carbon-pulse.com/394174/)[has firmly restated](https://carbon-pulse.com/394174/) its commitment to a 2027 launch of the EU ETS2, underlining that the “legislation is already adopted and in force” and that no revision of its provisions is foreseen before 2028.
In addition to mitigation, climate finance will be a central and contentious issue in Bonn. Developing countries were disappointed by last year’s [New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG)](https://unfccc.int/NCQG), which pledged 300 billion dollars annually in public/private finance by 2035, and a broader goal of 1.3 trillion dollars per year. They’re now demanding concrete steps to clarify how and when that figure will be reached. Parties in Bonn will focus on adaptation and the just transition, especially via the [Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA)](https://unfccc.int/topics/adaptation-and-resilience/workstreams/gga) and the so-called [UAE Dialogue](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/UAE_dialogue.pdf), which aims to track progress on key mitigation goals like renewables expansion and fossil fuel reduction. Negotiations are also complicated by the absence of the US delegation. Some observers say this could allow other nations to step up and much hope goes to Brazil, positioning itself as a diplomatic bridge-builder.

Around half of university students in Germany feel that climate change affects their mental health negatively, according to [a survey](https://www.haw-hamburg.de/detail/news/news/show/unter-studierenden-ist-die-angst-vor-dem-klimawandel-real/) by the University of Applied Sciences Hamburg and insurer mkk. Around 57 percent of over 4,600 students surveyed said they find heatwaves psychologically taxing, while over 40 percent reported feeling high or extreme levels of climate anxiety.
Concerns were greater among those already suffering from mental illness, and those who had already experienced extreme weather events themselves were also more likely to report higher levels of anxiety, the survey showed. Moreover, students who more frequently consumed climate change information tended to report higher psychological stress levels. However, this could also be interpreted as students consuming more climate change information because they were concerned, author Juliane Stolz pointed out. "The survey shows that fear of climate change among students is real, and its extent depends on individual factors," she added.
Climate change, which makes extreme weather events such as floods and droughts more likely and intense, affects people's physical and mental health around the world. Awareness of rapid global warming and its consequences can have negative consequences for mental well-being. One in two Germans say they feel weighed down psychologically by climate change and its effects, according to [a recent survey](http://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/half-germans-say-climate-change-weighs-their-psyche) by the Federal Environment Agency ([UBA](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/uba-federal-environment-agency)).
"Climate change requires people who are capable of taking action," [said](https://www.meine-krankenkasse.de/presse-politik/studie-klimaangst-unter-studierenden) Andrea Galle, member of the executive board of mkk. "Given the health consequences of climate change, students also need mental resilience so that they can cope with the challenges of everyday life in the long term." Irrespective of climate change, almost 30 percent of students reported feeling burdened psychologically.

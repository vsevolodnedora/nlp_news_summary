The conservative alliance of the Christian Democratic Union ([CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)) and the Christian Social Union ([CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union)) has said it aims to strengthen Germany’s competitiveness as a basis for climate protection. “A strong economy is the basic prerequisite for everything, for a good social policy as well as for a good environmental and climate protection policy,” said chancellor candidate Friedrich Merz, presenting the [party's programme](https://www.politikwechsel.cdu.de/sites/www.politikwechsel.cdu.de/files/docs/politikwechsel-fuer-deutschland-wahlprogramm-von-cdu-csu.pdf) for the election in February 2025. “Nothing works without a good economy.”
In their programme, the two parties which jointly enter the race, said Germany “no longer is the world's export champion” and that companies complained “about high energy prices, bureaucratic madness and a constant stream of new regulations, a lack of skilled labour and an overwhelming tax burden.” The conservative party alliance said it wants to establish Germany as an innovation location for future technologies, and present a “high-tech agenda” for research, innovation and technologies.
They aim to lower [grid fees](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_g#grid_fees) and the electricity tax to help businesses, reduce bureaucracy and abolish the national supply chain law. The [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) alliance also wants to enable technologies such as [carbon capture and storage](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_c#carbon_capture_and_storage) or use ([CCS](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_c#ccs), [CCU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_c#ccu)).
The programme emphasises that car manufacturing should be maintained as a leading German industry. The two parties “reject anti-car attitudes, driving bans for city centres, the reallocation of parking spaces and a general speed limit on German motorways.” They call for a reform of CO2 fleet limits in the EU to prevent fines for carmakers.
Germany is headed for snap elections after chancellor Olaf Scholz’s coalition government broke up in November. Climate and energy policy played a major role in the coalition break-up, and [many decisions key for reaching binding 2030 climate targets are in limbo](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/vote25-mixed-climate-legacy-scholzs-collapsed-coalition-leaves-challenges-next-government). Putting the country on track for its numerous emissions cutting and energy transition ambitions until the end of the decade will be [the task of the next government](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/dossiers/germanys-snap-elections-reaching-2030-climate-and-energy-targets-will-depend-next-government). Polls show the [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) clearly in the lead, making it likely that the parties will lead the next coalition government.

# Tracking the making of Germany's new government
Germans cast their vote in the country's federal election on 23 February. Conservative CDU/CSU leader Friedrich Merz is set to become the next chancellor and will now lead the formal coalition negotiations with the Social Democrats (SPD). The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) saw its greatest election success to date, but the CDU/CSU has ruled out forming a government with them. Coalition negotiations can last anywhere from a handful of weeks to a couple of months. This tracker follows developments from ballot closure to the formation of a new coalition government. [UPDATES to 6 May]
_*** Please note: This tracker has ended on 6 May with the formation of Germany's new government.

**Germany’s new government with bumpy start after Merz needs unprecedented second vote for chancellor**
Conservative leader Friedrich [Merz managed to secure a majority in parliament to become the next chancellor](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/merzs-failure-secure-majority-first-round-chancellor-vote-stuns-germany) only in the second round of voting. The unprecedented failure to immediately establish clarity on a chancellor vote in the first round does not directly impede his government’s ability to act. However, the dissent within the coalition’s own ranks bodes ill for more controversial questions in the future, a political analyst commented.
**Merz’s failure to secure majority in first round of chancellor vote stuns Germany**
Germany’s conservative leader Friedrich Merz failed to secure the necessary majority to become chancellor of Europe’s biggest economy in a first round of voting in parliament. The unprecedented result stunned lawmakers and observers alike, failing to immediately provide the stability and clarity many had hoped for. Merz can still become chancellor in a subsequent vote, which was set to take place later on the same day.
**[CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) and [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) sign coalition agreement**
The three future government partners [have signed](https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/koalitionsvertrag-unterzeichnet-100.html) the [coalition agreement](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/what-germanys-aspiring-coalition-government-agreement-means-climate-and-energy), officially sealing their alliance for the next four years.
**[SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) designates former minister of state for Eastern Germany as next environment minister **
The Social Democrats [have decided](https://www.spd.de/fileadmin/Dokumente/Das_SPD-Regierungsteam_fuer_die_21._Legislaturperiode.pdf) that the former minister of state for Eastern Germany Carsten Schneider will be responsible for the country’s climate policy portfolio as the next minister for environment, climate, nature protection and nuclear safety. The buildings ministry will be headed by lawmaker Verena Hubertz and the development ministry by Reem Alabali-Radovan.
**Coalition agreement less clear and ambitious than under previous government – researchers**
The coalition agreement by the conservative [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) alliance and the Social [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) is “less ambitious and less clear” than that of the previous coalition government, said [a report](https://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/de/publikationen/publikation/did/einwurf-032025-erfolgreich-gescheitert) by Bertelsmann Foundation. “Even before taking office, the new coalition is discussing the interpretation of key provisions,” criticised the researchers. They called for a strong role of the incoming chancellor to ensure good governance.
The report summarised to what extent the government of the past four years had lived up to the promises made in the coalition agreement. The researchers said that, regarding policies under the responsibility of the economy and climate ministry, the coalition had made good on almost 60 percent of its promises.
**[SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) approves coalition agreement, to present ministers on 5 May**
The Social Democratic Party ([SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party)) [approved](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/next-german-government-clears-final-hurdle-spd-approves-coalition-agreement) the coalition agreement with the conservative [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) alliance, clearing the final major hurdle to the swearing-in of the new German government on 6 May. The party announced it would present its nominations for ministers, including on climate and on buildings, on 5 May.
**[SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) enters last day of members' vote on coalition agreement **
The vote by the Social Democratic Party ([SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party)) members to accept or reject the coalition agreement with the conservatives ends today at midnight. [German media expected](https://www.fr.de/politik/wegen-merz-und-spahn-spd-mitgliederentscheid-zu-koalitionsvertrag-wird-spannend-93705390.html) the [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) to share the result one day later (30 April).
**Conservative[CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union) approves coalition agreement**
Soon-to-be chancellor Friedrich Merz’s conservative Christian Democratic Party ([CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)) [has approved](https://apnews.com/article/germany-coalition-government-merz-bb12de17353245279d87cc80192135d8) the coalition treaty with its Bavarian sister party [CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) and the Social Democrats ([SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party)), clearing one of the last hurdles for the next government.
**Conservatives present designated ministers**
Germany’s [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) alliance has presented the names of the designated conservative ministers in the next government. Energy industry manager Katherina Reiche is set to head the economy and energy ministry. [[Read more](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/make-germanys-next-government-energy-manager-head-economy-ministry).]
**Coalition agreement to be signed on 5 May**
The coalition agreement between the conservative [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) alliance and the Social Democrats ([SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party)) to form Germany's next federal government is set to be signed at midday on 5 May in Berlin, [according](https://checkpoint.tagesspiegel.de/newsletter/6K27OmBzE4gWbVs0VLDr3W) to Tagesspiegel Checkpoint. Members of the [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) still must agree to the coalition treaty – the results of their vote will be made public on 30 April. [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union) leader Friedrich Merz will stand in parliament for election as chancellor on 6 May.
**Aspiring coalition preparing immediate relief package for the economy – report**
The budding coalition government in Germany is working on an immediate relief package for the country’s economy after taking office on 6 May, newspaper Handelsblatt [reported](https://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/deutschland/neue-bundesregierung-merz-will-die-wirtschaft-sofort-um-milliarden-entlasten/100123299.html). This would include special write-offs for the entire year 2025 that should get prepared as quickly as possible, conservative [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union) parliamentary group leader Thorsten Frei said. Further relief should be brought by reduced energy prices and a special industry electricity price, according to conservative lawmakers. However, in a first step, the new government would have to agree on a final budget for 2025, after a deal fell flat following the outgoing government’s collapse in November 2024. This should be achieved “before the summer break” in mid-July, Frei added.
**[SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) climate group calls on members to reject coalition agreement **
The climate network of the Social Democrats ([SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party)), [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party).klima.gerecht, have [appealed to the party's members to reject](https://www.spdklimagerecht.de/_files/ugd/1e0e5d_822872606096400f82c97bace5a12f76.pdf) the [coalition treaty](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/what-germanys-aspiring-coalition-government-agreement-means-climate-and-energy) with the conservative [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) alliance. "We cannot agree to this agreement as it stands," the group wrote in a statement, calling for the coalition treaty to be revised "with a clear agenda for the abolition of fossil fuel subsidies, a plan to phase out gas infrastructure, clear and socially just support measures for the [decarbonisation](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_d#decarbonisation) of all households, and an industrial policy that ensures Germany's competitiveness in a climate-neutral world."
**[BSW](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bsw-sahra-wagenknecht-alliance) appeals against federal election result, wants to force recount**
The nationalist-left party Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance ([BSW](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bsw-sahra-wagenknecht-alliance)) has logged an appeal with Election Review Committee against the results of the [23 February federal elections](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/dossiers/germanys-snap-elections-reaching-2030-climate-and-energy-targets-will-depend-next-government), public broadcaster ARD [reported](https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/innenpolitik/bsw-bundestagswahl-einspruch-100.html). The party, which was 9,529 votes away from clearing the five percent threshold to make it into parliament, claims that not all of its votes were counted. The Election Review Committee has received almost 900 appeals, with initiators largely complaining about problems with postal voting for Germans living abroad.
If the [BSW](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bsw-sahra-wagenknecht-alliance) were to enter parliament should a recount happen, the planned coalition between the [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) alliance and the [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) would probably lose its majority.
**Merz set to finalise cabinet positions by the end of the week**
Chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz from the conservative [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union) is set to finalise his cabinet list by the end of this week, Table.Media reported. While the division of ministries was announced together with the coalition treaty, the question of who will lead each post has not yet been decided.
**Senior[CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union) politician’s opening to far-right [AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) fiercely rejected by [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) leadership **
Senior members of Germany’s conservative [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) alliance and of its prospective coalition partner, the Social Democrats ([SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party)), have clashed over the best approach to dealing with the far-right [AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) party in parliament. [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union) politician Jens Spahn, former health minister and an influential voice in the party, had [suggested](https://www.bild.de/politik/inland/jens-spahn-fordert-umgang-mit-afd-im-parlament-67fba61c2be3ce37c1b83fb8) in tabloid Bild to treat the [AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) “just like any other opposition party” and allow it to lead committees in parliament to respect the democratic vote that brought them there. The [AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) has been classified as partially right-wing extremist by Germany’s domestic intelligence agency. Other [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union) members supported Spahn’s proposal, which runs counter to the CDU’s general “firewall” policy that rejects direct cooperation with the [AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) on many levels. However, other [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union) members also publicly rejected Spahn’s idea.
The SPD’s secretary general, Matthias Miersch, on news station ntv [called](https://www.n-tv.de/politik/Was-Spahn-sagt-ist-grundfalsch-und-sehr-gefaehrlich-article25708377.html) Spahn’s proposal “fundamentally wrong and very, very dangerous.” The [AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) would question Germany’s constitutional order, and every democrat would have to remain “very, very vigilant” with respect to it. “There can be no normality.”
**[SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) to let members vote on coalition treaty until 29 April**
Members of the Social Democrats ([SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party)) have been given two weeks to vote on the coalition treaty which they worked out with the conservative [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) alliance, from 15 to 29 April, and decide whether the aspiring coalition government of chancellor candidate Friedrich Merz can be formed, public broadcaster ZDF [reported](https://www.zdf.de/nachrichten/politik/deutschland/spd-abstimmung-koalitionsvertrag-bundesregierung-100.html). At least 20 percent of the roughly 358,000 [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) members must vote, and a majority consent is needed. The result will be presented on 30 April.
Especially the SPD’s youth organisations have voiced criticism of the deal with the conservative alliance and called for amending the treaty. However, [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) co-leader Lars Klingbeil said there will be no further negotiations and that new elections would have to be called if the [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) and the [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) failed to find an agreement.
**Most[CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union), [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) and [Green Party](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/green-party) voters approve of coalition treaty**
The [coalition treaty](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/what-germanys-aspiring-coalition-government-agreement-means-climate-and-energy) presented by the conservative [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) alliance and the Social Democrats ([SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party)) has been welcomed by the majority of their respective voters – as well as by most [Green Party](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/green-party) voters, a [poll](https://www.stern.de/politik/deutschland/koalitionsvertrag--so-denken-die-deutschen-darueber-35637132.html) commissioned by magazine Stern has found. However, 45 percent of respondents said they were “rather disappointed” with the 144-page agreement, while 43 percent were “rather satisfied.” Twelve percent did not give an opinion.
Sixty-nine percent of [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) voters and 64 percent of [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) voters said they approved the treaty, while it was rejected by 24 percent and 23 percent, respectively. Forty-eight percent of [Green Party](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/green-party) voters said they regarded the treaty positively, while 46 percent said they were not satisfied with it. From the opposition, 58 percent of [Left Party](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/left-party) and 84 percent of far-right [AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) voters rejected the treaty. 
**Merz set to be elected chancellor on 6 May**
The election of conservative leader Friedrich Merz as German chancellor is scheduled to take place on 6 May, newspaper Tagesspiegel [reported](https://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/start-fur-schwarz-rot-merz-soll-am-6-mai-zum-bundeskanzler-gewahlt-werden-13527598.html). According to the article, the [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union) politician-led new coalition government could start its work on that day, if delegates of the conservative party and the members of its coalition party, the centre-left [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party), give their consent to the pair’s coalition treaty. 
**Aspiring German government opts for energy transition continuity in coalition treaty**
Germany’s prospective government [has agreed in its coalition treaty ](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/aspiring-german-government-opts-energy-transition-continuity)to continue the country’s landmark energy transition without major adjustments and stick to existing climate targets. The energy industry [praised the continuation of existing policy, while environmental NGOs showed relief](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/reactions-energy-and-climate-community-germanys-2025-coalition-treaty) over the treaty’s climate commitments, both on a domestic and the EU level. [ _This factsheet breaks down what it says on climate and energy._](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/what-germanys-aspiring-coalition-government-agreement-means-climate-and-energy)
**[CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) and [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) will present coalition treaty on Wednesday afternoon - report**
The heads of Germany's prospective government parties, the conservative [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) alliance and the centre-left [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party), have concluded their coalition negotiations, news site Zeit Online [reported](https://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2025-04/regierungsbildung-koalitionsvertrag-union-spd-live#event_id=enpMdqCvcDZHtkAVFmz6). According to the report, negotiators from the parties were settling some last open questions on Wednesday morning before planing to announce the results in the afternoon, at a press conference scheduled for 3PM (CEST). "The coalition treaty is ready," sources close to the talks told news station ntv on Tuesday evening. 
The timetable presented by the [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union) at the beginning of the coalition negotiations to conclude the talks before Easter could thus be kept. This means [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union) leader Friedrich Merz could be elected as chancellor by members of parliament on 6 May, ntv [said](https://www.n-tv.de/politik/Koalitionsvertrag-soll-bis-zum-Mittag-stehen-article25689820.html).
**US tariff announcement and market swings impacts German coalition talks**
Chancellor in-waiting Friedrich Merz has said that the stock market swings caused by the [US announcement for tariffs](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/german-energy-and-industry-sectors-worried-about-destructive-us-trade-policy) mean that Germany has to urgently re-establish its international competitiveness, reported news station ntv. “This question must now be at the centre of the coalition negotiations,” he said, emphasising the need for tax cuts, fewer bureaucratic hurdles, lower energy prices and keeping social security costs in check.
Caretaker chancellor Olaf Scholz also [invited](https://www.n-tv.de/politik/Scholz-ruft-Spitzen-von-Union-und-SPD-zu-Krisentreffen-article25686613.html) prospective future government politicians to coordinate possible steps of the EU’s reaction to the tariffs.
**Lead negotiators want to finalise coalition treaty by the middle of the week - media report**
The party leaders of both the [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) and the [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) want to finalise the coalition agreement by the middle of this week, [two unnamed negotiators told](https://table.media/berlin/professional-briefing/merz-zwischen-afd-und-spd-koalitionsvertrag-bis-mitte-der-woche-akk-fuer-erhalt-des-bmz/) table.media. The agreement is then set to be published, before the [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) is given two and a half weeks to approve the treaty, while the [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union) plans to convene a small party conference. The agreement could then be signed at the end of April or beginning of May, the article said.
**Negotiators agree 5-cent power price relief for energy-intensive industry – media report**
Negotiator sources [told](https://table.media/berlin) Table.Media that the prospective coalition parties agreed to ensure that energy intensive industries would also profit from plans to lower electricity prices by 5 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh). These companies are largely already exempt from electricity tax and [grid fees](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_g#grid_fees) – the two levers the next government aims to use to lower prices, writes Table.Media. While the exact implementation was still being debated, it could be done by increasing existing CO2 cost subsidies ([electricity price compensation](https://www.dehst.de/EN/Topics/SPK/spk-understanding/spk-understanding_node.html)), but this would require the green light from the EU based on state aid rules.
While power prices paid by individual companies in Germany vary widely, the average electricity price paid in new contracts by German companies was 18.75 ct/kWh in March 2025, energy industry group [BDEW](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bdew-german-association-energy-and-water-industries) found in a recent [analysis](https://www.bdew.de/service/daten-und-grafiken/bdew-strompreisanalyse/). 
**100 business associations call for more focus on economy in coalition talks**
More than 100 business associations – including industry association [BDI](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bdi-federation-german-industries) and the Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry ([DIHK](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/association-german-chambers-commerce-and-industry)) – published [a joint appeal](https://bdi.eu/artikel/news/erklaerung-der-deutschen-wirtschaft-zu-den-koalitionsverhandlungen) to the prospective coalition to put more focus on the economy. Leaks from the talks have the associations worried. They called for “massive structural reforms” to lower energy costs for companies, less bureaucracy, lower corporate taxes and a reform of social security systems to lower costs for companies. "The economic situation has worsened dramatically in recent weeks. Trade conflicts are escalating, inflation is rising and growth is weakening further," the appeal said.
**Vote for chancellor in early May?**
Table Media reported that the prospective coalition partners plan to have everything sealed and done to vote Friedrich Merz as Germany’s next chancellor in early May (7 May). The coalition treaty, which could be worked out within the coming week or so, must still be agreed by each party, and the [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) plans to let party members vote in a two-week process.
**Conservative lawmakers flesh out considerations to bring shut-down nuclear reactors back online**
Lawmakers in the German conservative parliamentary group have floated a paper in which they detail considerations to bring decommissioned nuclear power plants back online if an assessment shows that this is “technically feasible and economically sensible”, [reported](https://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/deutschland/energie-so-koennte-deutschland-den-atomausstieg-noch-zurueckdrehen/100117904.html) Handelsblatt. They propose that the state would have to take over if the former operators were not interested in restarting the plants. The topic has been [a point of contention in the coalition talks](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/energy-and-climate-crunch-points-germanys-upcoming-coalition-talks). The [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union) insists on "a technical assessment as quickly as possible" to see whether it is possible to resume the operation of Germany's last decommissioned nuclear power plants "at reasonable technical and financial cost” and to "immediately stop" the plant's dismantling. In its party manifesto, the [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) reiterated that nuclear is phased out in Germany, "and this is good”.
**Coalition talks continue in small groups, budget key issue**
Budget questions continue to be one of the biggest hurdles in the ongoing coalition talks, which are now held in smaller negotiation teams, [reported](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/koalitionsverhandlungen-news-cdu-csu-spd-li.3227118) news agency dpa. Talks would likely continue throughout the week, said [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) state premier of Mecklenburg Western Pomerania Manuela Schwesig. She [told](https://www.tagesschau.de/multimedia/video/video-1450508.html) public broadcaster ARD that the 500 billion euros from the infrastructure fund should be used for “good roads, safe bridges, modernising rails to ensure timetables are kept, kindergartens, schools, and hospitals” and more housing. These investments would pay off in the long-run, even if they are debt-financed, she added.
**Promise to abolish heating law set to turn into communication challenge for German conservatives**
An election promise by German conservative alliance of the Christian Democrat Union ([CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)) and the Christian Social Union ([CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union)) to abolish parts of the country’s Building Energy Law is [turning into a communication challenge](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/promise-abolish-heating-law-set-turn-communication-challenge-german-conservatives) for the party of chancellor candidate Friedrich Merz, reported Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. In its election manifesto, the [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) alliance had vowed to undo passages of the law that deal with the replacement of fossil fuel-based heating systems with climate friendly alternatives, especially heat pumps. After performing a U-turn from its campaign positions on fiscal policy by adopting [Germany’s massive new spending package](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/qa-germanys-eu500-bln-infrastructure-fund-whats-it-climate-and-energy), the [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) could be forced to backtrack on another key policy, which might alienate many voters, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said. 
**Conservative proposal for offsetting Germany's emissions outside the EU eyed critically by climate researchers**
Plans to adapt Germany’s Climate Action Law to [allow for national emissions compensation measures to also take place in countries outside of the European Union](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/conservative-proposal-offsetting-germanys-emissions-outside-eu-eyed-critically-climate-researchers) have been criticised for potentially [opening the door to fraudulent projects that could undermine effective action](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/germany-suspects-serious-environmental-crime-chinese-co2-reduction-projects-env-minister). The proposa[l](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/prospective-new-german-government-shows-no-ambition-speed-coal-exit) by Germany’s conservative alliance of the Christian Democrat Union ([CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)) and the Christian Social Union ([CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union)) to expand compensation mechanisms beyond the EU would amount to a “gigantic step backwards”, researcher Niklas Höhne from the New Climate Institute told energy policy newsletter Tagesspiegel Background. As almost all countries would lag behind their national emissions reduction targets, “there’s nothing to gain abroad for Germany” and additional reductions could not be expected, he argued.
The idea, launched by the [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) alliance, comes from [leaked coalition negotiation papers](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/prospective-new-german-government-shows-no-ambition-speed-coal-exit) with the Social Democrats ([SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party)), the parties which together look set to form the next government. The [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) proposed that “residual emissions” could be offset by “credible CO2 reduction measures in partner countries in line with global and European rules”, and that these options should also become anchored in national and European climate laws, for example in the EU's Emissions Trading System ([ETS](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_e#ets)).
**Senior[SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) negotiator says coalition talks entering home stretch**
Anke Rehlinger, state premier of Saarland from the Social Democrats, said the aspiring coalition partners of her [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) and the conservative [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) alliance have begun mobilising their reserves for the “home stretch” of negotiations that should take place this week. [According to](https://www.wiwo.de/politik/deutschland/koalition-koalitionsverhandlungen-auf-der-zielgeraden/100117571.html) newspaper WirtschaftsWoche, the negotiating parties have three weeks left to remain within their self-imposed schedule to form a new government by Easter, a move that the [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) has said will hinge on the consent of its members in an internal vote.
The parties were still in intensive talks about how to spend the money made available by Germany’s massive spending package on infrastructure and climate neutrality, the newspaper said. They also remained split over the question of how to consolidate the budget, for which tax increases have been considered.
**Lead negotiators optimistic over chances for coalition treaty,[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) aims for Easter deadline **
The coalition treaty of Germany’s new government could be concluded within the timeframe envisaged by the conservative [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) alliance and the [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party), the parties’ lead negotiators said in a [debate](https://www.zdf.de/play/talk/maybrit-illner-128/maybrit-illner-vom-27-maerz-2025-100?staffel=2025) hosted by public broadcaster ARD. “It’s only been four weeks since the election and we’ve already come a long way,” said Bavarian [CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) parliamentary group leader Alexander Dobrindt, adding that “speed is not the aim here, but rather thoroughness.”
In an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJR4OI35IAM) with news station ntv, Dobrindt said an agreement between the conservative alliance and the Social Democrats could be achieved by Easter. The SPD’s secretary-general, Matthias Miersch, said on ARD that the negotiators have recently made substantial progress on “contentious issues” and moved closer towards concluding a coalition treaty. “I believe that this coalition will come about -- but we still have lot of work ahead of us,” Miersch added.
**Coalition negotiations enter next phase**
Senior members of the [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) alliance and the [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) will [meet on Friday, 28 March](https://www.wiwo.de/politik/deutschland/koalitionsverhandlungen-naechste-koalitionsverhandlungsrunde-am-freitag/30268258.html), to begin the work of settling on a final coalition agreement. The 'core' negotiating group – which includes 19 leading representatives from the parties – will come together several times now that working groups with specialist politicians have [completed their preliminary work](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/prospective-new-german-government-shows-no-ambition-speed-coal-exit).
The parties will have to iron out differences, especially in areas such as immigration. Still, the secretaries-general Carsten Linnemann ([CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)), Matthias Miersch ([SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party)) and Martin Huber ([CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union)) [said](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/german-parties-press-with-government-formation-despite-differences-migration-2025-03-26/): "We share the goal of laying the foundations for a strong, capable government."
**Newly elected German parliament holds inaugural session**
The newly elected German parliament [convened today](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/25/german-parliament-sits-for-first-time-with-afd-as-main-opposition) for its first session. The new parliament has shrunk in size to 630 seats, down from 733 in the previous legislative period. [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union) member and former agriculture minister, Julia Klöckner, is to become the [new ](https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/innenpolitik/bundestag-konstituierung-fraktionen-kandidaten-praesidium-100.html)[president of the ](https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/innenpolitik/bundestag-konstituierung-fraktionen-kandidaten-praesidium-100.html)[Bundestag](https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/innenpolitik/bundestag-konstituierung-fraktionen-kandidaten-praesidium-100.html).
**German coalition negotiators agree to abolish heating law in current form – media**
Members of the conservative [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) alliance and the Social Democrats ([SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party)), the parties leading coalition negotiations to form Germany's next government, have agreed to abolish the so-called [heating law](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/qa-germany-debates-phaseout-fossil-fuel-heating-systems) in its current form, Table.Media [reported](https://table.media/berlin/professional-briefing/abschaffung-des-heizungsgesetzes-digital-first-grummeln-gegen-felssner/). Citing a final paper by the coalition negotiation working group on energy and climate – which was [confirmed by news agency DPA](https://www.handelsblatt.com/dpa/union-und-spd-koalitions-unterhaendler-wollen-heizungsgesetz-abschaffen/30270220.html) – members from both parties agreed to abolish the much-debated law, which stipulates the gradual phase-out of oil and gas heating systems.
Any replacement law would need to follow European guidelines, so similarly effective measures to reduce emissions in the heating sector would need to be adopted. Subsidies for a switch to climate-friendlier alternatives should be continued, according to the media reports.
The agreement is not final and will still be subject to discussion, with changes not ruled out. 
**Working groups in German coalition talks to present preliminary agreements**
The 16 working groups of the [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) alliance and the [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) will submit the first results of their coalition talks to the parties’ chief negotiators by 17:00 tonight. There were clear differences in the areas of tax reform, debt relief for municipalities, the introduction of a "climate bonus" to return CO2 revenues to citizens and the revision of Germany's "heating law," Table.Media reported. Still, the working groups have to adhere to the deadline regardless of progress. Anything not agreed upon in these sub-groups will be decided by the core negotiating group.
**Coalition building by Easter now unlikely – media**
It is becoming increasingly unlikely that a new coalition government of the [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) and the [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) will be formed by Easter, as was envisaged by conservative leader Friedrich Merz, RTL [reported](https://www.fr.de/politik/koalitionsverhandlungen-treten-heute-in-neue-phase-ein-alte-streitpunkte-bleiben-zr-93643913.html). Many key issues are still unresolved in the negotiations, so there is now talk of deadlines in May, according to the broadcaster.
**German state governments greenlight historic spending plan**
Germany’s major spending package that contains a reform of the country’s debt brake and hundreds of billions of euros of investments in defence, infrastructure and climate action [has cleared the last hurdle](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/historic-german-spending-package-gets-final-approval-clears-path-merzs-coalition-government), as the Council of Federal States (Bundesrat) greenlighted the law proposed by the prospective coalition government of the [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) and [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party).
**Parties consider cuts to budget following agreement on €500bn spending package on infrastructure and climate**
The negotiating prospective coalition parties [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) and [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) have started to look into possible budget cuts after pushing for a major investment package in infrastructure and climate neutrality of 500 billion euros over twelve years. According to acting [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) chancellor Olaf Scholz, the 2025 budget still has a gap of 26 billion euros. While the special fund agreed by parliament earlier this week could provide some relief, the parties are still looking for other areas where austerity measures are possible, newspaper Merkur [reported](https://www.merkur.de/wirtschaft/cdu-und-spd-streben-kuerzungen-im-haushalt-an-buergergeld-und-elterngeld-koennten-gestrichen-werden-zr-93632763.html).
**German parliament adopts reform to allow €500 bln new debt for infrastructure and climate**
Germany's parliament has adopted a constitutional reform to allow the country to [take up hundreds of billions of euros in new debt to finance defence, infrastructure and climate investments](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/german-parliament-adopts-reform-allow-eu500-bln-new-debt-infrastructure-and-climate). The reform, which must still get the [green light from federal state governments on Friday this week](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/focus-germanys-state-governments-eu500-bln-infrastructure-package-awaits-adoption), allows the government to borrow more money through reforms and exemptions to the so-called "debt brake." Defence expenditures beyond one percent of national GDP will not count towards the debt limit, and neither will a new 500-billion-euros special fund for additional infrastructure and climate investments. The necessary two-thirds majority was reached, as 513 of the Bundestag’s 733 lawmakers voted in favour, with zero abstentions.
**Climate money payout to citizens unlikely to come also under new govt -[CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)**
The so-called climate money ("Klimageld") payments promised as a compensation mechanism for citizens facing higher energy costs due to rising carbon prices by Germany’s outgoing government likely will also not be implemented under the prospective new coalition, [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union) politician Andreas Jung [told](https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/klima-nachhaltigkeit/union-will-co2-einnahmen-ueber-strompreissenkungen-zurueckgeben-110361779.html) the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. Instead, the negotiating conservative [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) alliance and the Social Democrats ([SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party)) planned to use the expected 15 billion euros in proceeds from carbon pricing this year for lowering energy prices and grid. “Our climate money is this climate bonus,” Jung said, arguing that this mechanism also ensured the money is returned to citizens and companies. The outgoing government had planned to pay out the climate money only to citizens. Jung [had told public broadcaster Dlf](https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/klimaziele-im-grundgesetz-interview-mit-andreas-jung-cdu-umweltpolitiker-100.html) that the prospective coalition would still negotiate how to use [emissions trading](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_e#emissions_trading) revenues in the mid-term. 
**[CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union) climate advocates warn Merz to not abolish outgoing government’s heating law**
Advocates of more ambitious climate policy from within the conservative Christian Democrat Union ([CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)) have warned the party of likely incoming chancellor Friedrich Merz not to abolish the outgoing government’s controversial heating law if there is no adequate alternative in place to achieve equivalent emissions reduction in the sector, the Berliner Morgenpost [reported](https://www.morgenpost.de/politik/article408574728/heizungsgesetz-vor-dem-aus-cdu-mann-mit-deutlicher-warnung.html). Thomas Heilmann, head of the [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)-affiliated Klimaunion, an association of pro-climate party members, said a legal review had shown that significant changes to the law would be difficult from a judicial point of view if they affect the law’s key aims, as Germany “is legally obliged to enact effective climate protection.” However, a reform that ensures similar or more ambitious emissions reduction would be possible. In its election campaign, the [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union) had said it would repeal the law drafted by [Green Party](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/green-party) economy minister Robert Habeck. In a first agreement from the CDU’s ongoing coalition negotiations with the Social Democrats ([SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party)), the law was not mentioned.
**2045 climate neutrality to be included in German constitution**
The [Green Party](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/green-party) has successfully insisted on including the goal of [greenhouse gas](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_g#greenhouse_gas) neutrality by 2045 in Germany’s constitution as part of their deal with the conservative [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) alliance and the [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) to support a major spending package in parliament, the Süddeutsche Zeitung [reported](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/sondervermoegen-union-spd-koalition-gruene-bundesrat-li.3219980?reduced=true). The goal will be mentioned in a new article in the constitution on the 500-billion-euro special fund for infrastructure investment. The article states that the fund will “raise additional investments for infrastructure and additional investments for reaching climate neutrality by 2045 with a volume of up to 500 billion euros.” However, the article does not make the climate target a new general objective of the state, but rather regulates what the special fund’s money can be used for. Legal experts say that the changes would not mean that lawsuits for more ambitious climate action from the state have a better chance of success in the future, Table Media [reported](https://table.media/berlin/professional-briefing/haushalt-und-spielraum-klima-und-anwaelte-soeder-und-der-bundesrat/). Germany adopted the 2045 target in its climate action law following a ruling by the country’s Constitutional Court that emissions reduction measures require a clear target framework to ensure greater inter-generational fairness.
**Merz reaches deal on infrastructure fund by promising Greens €100 bln for climate action**
Germany's chancellor-in-waiting, conservative Christian Democrat Union ([CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)) leader Friedrich Merz, has [reached a breakthrough deal on the 500-billion-euros infrastructure fund](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/merz-reaches-deal-infrastructure-fund-promising-greens-eu100-bln-climate-action) proposed by his prospective coalition government, by promising to dedicate a fifth of the sum to climate action. Merz agreed to transfer 100 billion euros of the sum to to the country’s Climate and Transformation Fund (KTF), which is dedicated to climate policy spending, thus securing support from the Greens, whose votes are required for the necessary constitutional changes.
**[SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) climate advocates call on party to uphold ambitious transformation policies **
A network of proponents of more ambitious climate policies within the [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) has weighed in on the coalition talks between their party and the conservative [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) alliance under Friedrich Merz, warning that a possible new coalition government muss remain steadfast on emissions reduction and the energy transition. “Large parts of the newly elected parliament reject responsible climate and social policy,” the network [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party).Klima.Gerecht ([SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party).Climate.Just) said with a view to representatives of the climate-denialist far-right [AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany), news magazine Der Spiegel [reported](https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/klimakrise-spd-politiker-warnen-vor-rueckschritten-in-koalitionsverhandlungen-a-1c2c2644-f30a-4fb8-9103-e2f1cd7f1d78). The [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) members said their party had a duty to defend ambitious climate policy and called for a range of measures the next government must pursue, including:


**Merz makes climate spending offer to Greens as formal coalition negotiations start**
Official coalition negotiations start today (13 March), preceded by a parliamentary debate on the planned constitutional changes to allow more debt for defence and infrastructure spending.
Deutsche Welle [reported](https://www.dw.com/en/german-politics-parliament-debates-debt-brake-reform/live-71905412) that chancellor candidate Merz in the debate sought to respond to the Green Party’s demands, promising to devote 50 billion euros from the planned special infrastructure fund to the country’s Climate and Transformation Fund (KTF). The KTF is dedicated to climate policy spending and played a central role in the outgoing government’s collapse, as a constitutional court ruling 2023 found it to be filled with unlawfully booked funds due to the debt brake. The [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union) leader reportedly also said that the debt brake could be lifted for investments in civil protection, which could include costly climate adaptation measures.
**Conservatives want to elect Merz as chancellor on 23 April**
The conservative [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) alliance has drawn up a detailed internal timetable for establishing a new government, which has been leaked to Reuters, [according to](https://www.n-tv.de/politik/Union-will-Merz-am-23-April-zum-Kanzler-waehlen-article25623178.html) ntv. The alliance would like to sign the coalition agreement it is seeking with the [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) in the week commencing on 14 April. The election of [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union) leader Friedrich Merz as the new chancellor is scheduled for 23 April in the document, Reuters reported. Formal coalition negotiations have not even started, and it remains unclear how long they will last, even though Merz has repeatedly said he wants to conclude negotiations around Easter (20 April).
**Parties name working group leaders for coalition negotiations**
[CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union) deputy leader Andreas Jung, who has long been the climate and energy spokesperson for the party, will lead the party's working group on these topics during the upcoming coalition negotiations, the party said. Lower Saxony’s transport minister, Olaf Lies, who is also a known expert on these topics, will lead the SPD’s corresponding negotiating team, the party [said](https://www.spd.de/service/pressemitteilungen/detail/news/212/03/2025).
**[Left Party](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/left-party) and far-right [AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) challenge plans to reform constitution in outgoing parliament**
The [Left Party](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/left-party) has lodged a [challenge](https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/sondervermoegen-und-schuldenbremse-die-linke-klagt-gegen-einberufung-des-alten-bundestags-a-aed5171b-4c9d-44ec-b8bb-2a8b5ad92b4a) with Germany's highest court against [plans](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/likely-next-german-govt-parties-agree-debt-rules-bypass-defence-and-infrastructure-climate-focus-unclear) from the country's budding coalition for a constitutional amendment to unlock hundreds of billions of euros with the support of majorities in the outgoing parliament. The party said it considers it inadmissible to make such far-reaching decisions with old majorities, Spiegel [reported](https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/sondervermoegen-und-schuldenbremse-die-linke-klagt-gegen-einberufung-des-alten-bundestags-a-aed5171b-4c9d-44ec-b8bb-2a8b5ad92b4a), adding that many newly elected members of parliament would be ‘excluded and exempted’ from the decision.
The far-right [AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) also lodged urgent legal motions with the constitutional court challenging plans to convene the country's outgoing parliament to consider the constitutional changes needed to introduce the [planned 500-billion-euro special fund for infrastructure](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/likely-next-german-govt-parties-agree-debt-rules-bypass-defence-and-infrastructure-climate-focus-unclear), [Reuters reported](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/german-far-right-challenges-attempt-put-spending-plans-old-parliament-2025-03-10/).

Coalition talks between the [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) alliance and the Social Democrats ([SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party)) are set to start on Thursday, 13 March. There should be first results from 16 working groups (each consisting of 16 people) as a basis for further talks after 10 days, newspaper Spiegel [reported](https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/cdu-und-spd-friedrich-merz-enthuellt-details-zu-arbeitsgruppen-bei-koalitionsgespraechen-a-34a6aa6f-9661-4776-b2a0-630a309b4df4?sara_ref=re-so-app-sh).
**Greens may refuse to back Merz in threat to massive debt plans**
The Greens [may refuse to back plans](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germanys-greens-may-refuse-back-merz-threat-massive-debt-plans-2025-03-10/) by likely next chancellor Friedrich Merz for a massive increase in state borrowing. The leaders of the Green parliamentary group Katharina Dröge and Britta Haßelmann [said](https://www.spiegel.de/politik/die-gruenen-wollen-grundgesetzaenderungen-zu-finanzen-nicht-zustimmen-a-41f69d08-771a-4745-8745-2226f6e9861d) that they recommended to their camp’s lawmakers to not support the constitutional reform necessary to allow more debt for defence and infrastructure spending.
**[CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) and [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) agree to enter formal coalition negotiations**
After laying out first policy proposals in an 11-page document at the end of first exploratory talks, the [CDU](https://www.tagesschau.de/newsticker/liveblog-regierungsbildung-montag-100.html), [CSU and SPD](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/koalitionsverhandlungen-union-spd-start-li.3215961) each agreed to enter formal coalition negotiations.
**Exploratory talks enter final stretch**
Several [German media report](https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article255609124/Sondierungsgespraeche-Sondierungen-gehen-in-entscheidende-Phase-Lammert-rechnet-mit-Verfassungsklage-Liveticker.html) that the exploratory talks – the so-called ‘Sondierungsgespräche’ to sound out whether forming a coalition is feasible and under which conditions negotiations would take place – could end as soon as today, or over the weekend. If successful, the parties will then decide to enter formal coalition negotiations, which will likely last for several weeks and conclude with a coalition treaty. [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union) leader Friedrich Merz has said that he wants a new government formed before Easter.
**Draft law does not specify sectors for planned German infrastructure fund**
First draft proposals for changes to the constitution to introduce a special fund for up to 500 billion euros worth of infrastructure investments in Germany [did not specify any sectors for which the money would be used](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/draft-law-does-not-specify-sectors-planned-german-infrastructure-fund).
**EU to profit from German infrastructure spending plans – analysts**
[Analysts said](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/eu-profit-german-infrastructure-spending-plans-analysts) that the European Union as a business location would profit from additional infrastructure investments planned by the likely next German government.
**First session of new parliament on 25 March**
The new parliament (Bundestag) after the election [will come together](https://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/textarchiv/2025/kw13-de-konstituierende-sitzung-1056494) for its first session on 25 March. Lawmakers will decide rules of procedure and vote on a new parliament president.
**Likely next German govt parties agree debt rules bypass for defence and infrastructure, climate focus unclear**
Germany’s likely next government coalition parties [have proposed an overhaul of state debt rules](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/likely-next-german-govt-parties-agree-debt-rules-bypass-defence-and-infrastructure-climate-focus-unclear) to make hundreds of billions of euros available for defence and infrastructure investments. The agreement, which faces a big hurdle in the two-thirds majority requirement in parliament, marks the first major deal in the coalition talks between the conservative [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) alliance of chancellor candidate Friedrich Merz and the Social Democrats. Details regarding what the infrastructure funding would be used for so far remain largely unclear. The [Green Party](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/green-party) as well as NGOs have called for clarity that climate action and the transition to a sustainable economy become a spending focus.
**Greens call for debt limit reform instead of emergency funding**
The [Green Party](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/green-party), whose votes would be needed to set up new debt-financed emergency funds for security and infrastructure investments, called for a “fundamental reform of the debt-brake”, Germany’s national rule to limit public debt, [reported Tagesspiegel Background](https://background.tagesspiegel.de/energie-und-klima/briefing/gruene-von-infrastruktur-sondervermoegen-nicht-ueberzeugt). Co-party leader Felix Banaszak said his party is “not convinced” of emergency funds currently debated by the conservatives and the [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) in their exploratory talks to form the next coalition government.
**NGO calls for “robust and just” federal budget instead of special funds**
The environmental NGO [Greenpeace](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/greenpeace-germany) has said that proposals to introduce new emergency funding for infrastructure investments fall short of what is actually needed – a “robust and just” German budget. The organisation called for more funds from the rich to help make Germany “future-proof”.
**[CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) and [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) consider special funds for defence and infrastructure in exploratory talks**
As exploratory talks to form a new federal government are underway, the conservative [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) alliance and the Social Democrats ([SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party)) are considering two special funds worth hundreds of billions of euros for defence and infrastructure respectively, with plans to set them up by the outgoing parliament, Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germany-weighs-special-funds-defence-infrastructure-sources-say-2025-03-02/).
The hope is that the funds, which could be worth around 400 billion euros for defence and 400-500 billion euros for infrastructure, will be approved by the outgoing parliament, the news agency reported. This would enable Germany to act quickly amid a [volatile geopolitical environment](https://www.rnd.de/politik/sondierungen-zwischen-union-und-spd-unter-dem-druck-der-weltlage-F356XRW7QNKQPGCUWAFMWVK2TI.html).
Installing such funds requires a two-thirds majority in parliament. However, following the snap election on 23 February, once the new parliament is set up by late March, the far-right [AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) and the [Left Party](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/left-party), both of which are critical towards the plans, will make up more than a third of lawmakers, which could delay action, or make it impossible.
The [Green Party](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/green-party) has said they would support an amendment to the country's debt rules, which are written into the constitution, to set up the funds, [according to Tagesspieg](https://background.tagesspiegel.de/energie-und-klima/briefing/sondierungen-diskussion-ueber-sondervermoegen-und-schuldenregeln)[e](https://background.tagesspiegel.de/energie-und-klima/briefing/sondierungen-diskussion-ueber-sondervermoegen-und-schuldenregeln)[l Background](https://background.tagesspiegel.de/energie-und-klima/briefing/sondierungen-diskussion-ueber-sondervermoegen-und-schuldenregeln). However, party leader Felix Banaszak argued that an increase in security spending must be accompanied by other investments. "We don't want to buy this at the price of our society falling apart, of climate protection falling by the wayside and of no more investment in schools and daycare centres," he said.
Environmental NGOs called on the [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) and [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) alliance to [focus ](https://www.rnd.de/politik/sondierungen-cdu-und-spd-was-verbaende-fuer-die-gespraeche-fordern-VE6KKR2R6VFBBGYHXBMIV2C2TY.html)[more ](https://www.rnd.de/politik/sondierungen-cdu-und-spd-was-verbaende-fuer-die-gespraeche-fordern-VE6KKR2R6VFBBGYHXBMIV2C2TY.html)[on climate protection](https://www.rnd.de/politik/sondierungen-cdu-und-spd-was-verbaende-fuer-die-gespraeche-fordern-VE6KKR2R6VFBBGYHXBMIV2C2TY.html) after initial exploratory talks. "Short- and long-term interests must be well balanced to avoid increasing uncertainties – for example, with regard to natural resources, drinking water or extreme weather events," [NABU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/nabu-nature-and-biodiversity-conservation-union) head Jörg-Andreas Krüger [told](https://www.rnd.de/politik/sondierungen-cdu-und-spd-was-verbaende-fuer-die-gespraeche-fordern-VE6KKR2R6VFBBGYHXBMIV2C2TY.html) broadcaster RND.
[SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) leader Lars Klingbeil [told](https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/klingbeil-spd-und-union-setzen-gespraeche-morgen-fort-100.html) public broadcaster ARD that the first exchange on Friday (28 February) was constructive and confidential. The next round of exploratory talks [started](https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/bundestagswahl/sondierungen-sondervermoegen-100.html)[ today](https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/bundestagswahl/sondierungen-sondervermoegen-100.html).
**[CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union) and [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) begin exploratory talks **
The conservative [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) alliance and the Social Democrats ([SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party)) today [begun exploratory talks to form a coalition](https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/bundestagswahl-union-und-spd-beginnen-am-freitag-mit-sondierungen-a-8fe2d86c-6396-4221-b1e1-bb662635d7f7). Nine representatives of each party will be present, and are set to come up with rough lines and a timetable for formal coalition talks. Observers [expect difficult negotiations](https://epaper.handelsblatt.com/epaper/handelsblatt-2025-02-28-epa-2333/?interactivelayer=96036), as considerable differences on government borrowing and migration, [as well as energy policy](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/energy-and-climate-crunch-points-germanys-upcoming-coalition-talks) will have to be overcome.
Merz has previously stated the goal of forming a coalition by Easter (20 April).
**[AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) demands more influence in new parliament as second biggest party **
The far-right [AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) has [demanded more influence](https://www.n-tv.de/politik/Die-AfD-beansprucht-mehr-Mitsprache-article25593322.html) in Germany’s next parliament that will convene on 25 March, given its success at the election, in which it doubled its share of the vote to more than 20 percent. Party leader Alice Weidel said she hoped that “other parliamentary groups do not continue their approach to the AfD” and integrate the party, whose state-level groups in eastern Germany have been [classified as “proven right-wing extremist”](https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-domestic-secret-service-battles-far-right-afd/a-68350993) by the domestic intelligence agency Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV).
Weidel said her party had the right to pick the parliament’s vice leader, head several parliamentary committees and get access to the national secret services control body. Other parties so far often have prevented the climate-denialist [AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) from relevant positions in the legislative body. Members of parliament are not obliged to vote for a representative of any one party as parliament leader. As the second strongest party in the new parliament, the [AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) will receive [more money, more speaking time](https://www.n-tv.de/politik/Mehr-Mandate-mehr-Redezeit-mehr-Geld-mehr-Einfluss-article25583991.html) and therefore likely also more influence than in previous ones, news station ntv reported.
**Germany’s former reactor operators lukewarm on Merz’s nuclear “dismantling moratorium” idea**
A proposal by Friedrich Merz, Germany’s likely next chancellor, for a “moratorium on dismantling” the remaining decommissioned nuclear reactors in the country [was met with reluctance](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/germanys-former-reactor-operators-lukewarm-merzs-nuclear-dismantling-moratorium-idea) by former nuclear plant operators. They said that stopping or even reversing the decommissioning process would take many years and enormous investment, as well as entail "substantial regulatory, financial, and staffing hurdles."
**Merz rules out quick reform of debt brake**
The conservative [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union) leader and likely next German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has rejected the idea of a quick reform to the country's constitutionally enshrined limit on new government borrowing, broadcaster MDR [reported](https://www.mdr.de/nachrichten/deutschland/politik/regierungsbildung-merz-klingbeil-pistorius-cdu-spd-wehretat-schuldenbremse-reform-100.html). Both him and current chancellor Olaf Scholz from the centre-left [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) had floated the idea to reform the so-called "debt brake" to unlock funds to increase defence spending, but also to enable much-needed future industry and infrastructure investments.
"It is out of the question that we will reform the debt brake in the near future," Merz said. "If it takes place at all, it will be a rather extensive and difficult task." Instead, his party [favours a special fund](https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/innenpolitik/schuldenbremse-reform-100.html) for defence spending.
Germany requires a two-thirds majority in parliament for amendments to the constitution.
**Merz and Scholz mull debt brake reform with outgoing parliament to avoid blocking minority**
The outgoing German parliament could use the time left until it dissolves and newly elected representatives constitute the next Bundestag on 25 March to adopt a reform of the country’s debt brake. Both current chancellor Olaf Scholz of the centre-left [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) and centre-right [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union) leader Friedrich Merz, whose party won the election, said that a reform of the constitutional ceiling on new government borrowing was on the cards before the next parliament takes over.
Due to the election result, the far-left [Left Party](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/left-party) and the far-right [AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) have a blocking minority and could prevent the two-thirds majority needed in parliament to change the constitution. “Whether we should or must make a decision here will be discussed with the other parties that currently still have a mandate,” [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union) leader Merz [said](https://www.mdr.de/nachrichten/deutschland/politik/schuldenbremse-merz-spd-gruene-alter-bundestag-100.html), adding that this would include possible votes by the [Green Party](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/green-party) and also by the pro-business [FDP](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/fdp-free-democratic-party), which will no longer be represented in the next Bundestag.
Chancellor Scholz said taking decisions with an outgoing parliament would be “rare but not impossible.” While the [AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) has said it rejects a reform of the rule outright, the [Left Party](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/left-party) has been open to removing the debt brake but generally avoids increased defense spending, one of the main tasks a new government will likely have to find funding for.
**[SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) leader says coalition agreement with Merz’s [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union) far from being done deal **
The SPD’s co-leader, Lars Klingbeil, has sought to cool down expectations of a fast coalition formation in Germany between his Social Democrats and the conservative [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) alliance under chancellor candidate Friedrich Merz. Klingbeil [said](https://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2025-02/bundestagswahl-spd-lars-klingbeil-koalition-union) it was not a done deal that his party will agree to form a coalition with Merz’s conservative alliance given the two parties’ differences in important policy areas and also due to Merz’s individual “course of action and tone.” The [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) co-leader said the expectation was for Merz to change his approach and make an offer to his potential coalition partner that makes a partnership attractive to them. This would include solutions to increase people’s purchasing power, stabilising pensions and enabling billions of euros in urgent investments. A coalition between the [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) and the [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) is seen as the only realistic two-party government that is possible after the snap election.
**Climate not a priority for most voters – exit polls**
Climate action did not play a major role in the decision of most voters at the snap election, exit polls made on election day have shown. Only 13 percent of surveyed voters [said](https://www.br.de/nachrichten/deutschland-welt/migration-wirtschaft-frieden-was-hat-die-bundestagswahl-entschieden,UdiIs3q) the topic had been a priority for them, compared to 18 percent saying domestic security was most important, followed by migration (15%), economic growth (15%) and international security (13%).
**Conservative election winner Merz seeks coalition with[SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party), Greens sidelined**
Conservative [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) leader Friedrich [Merz wants to enter coalition talks with the Social Democrats](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/conservative-german-election-winner-merz-seeks-coalition-spd-greens-sidelined) ([SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party)) of outgoing chancellor Olaf Scholz, after the elections’ result has paved the way for the two parties to form a government without a third party. The Green Party’s chances to get a seat in the country's next leadership therefore look very slim, meaning the party will likely not be able to continue to pursue its ambitious climate and energy policy in a new government. However, while a revival of the coalition between the conservatives and the [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) is unlikely to give [decarbonisation](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_d#decarbonisation) a boost in Germany, the parties together have overseen effective climate and energy policies in the past and stand the best chance of all constellations to form a new government quickly -- an outcome that both German voters and the country’s international partners hope for given the numerous challenges ahead.
**[BSW](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bsw-sahra-wagenknecht-alliance) considers legal review of election results**
The left-wing and anti-immigration Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance ([BSW](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bsw-sahra-wagenknecht-alliance)) is considering having the result of Germany's federal election legally reviewed, public broadcaster ARD [reported](https://www.tagesschau.de/newsticker/liveblog-bundestagswahl-2025-montag-100.html#BSW). The claim is based on the fact that many registered German voters living abroad complained they could not cast their votes due to the short snap election deadlines.
Around 230,000 German voters are registered outside of the country, and the [BSW](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bsw-sahra-wagenknecht-alliance) fell around 13,400 votes short of clearing the five percent threshold to enter parliament, ARD reported. "The question of the legal validity of the election result arises," party leader Sahra Wagenknecht said.
**[CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union) to lead coalition negotiations, majority possible with [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party)**
The conservative [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) alliance has won the most votes in Germany's snap election on 23 February – but it was one of the party's worst election results in history. The party under its chancellor candidate Friedrich Merz received 28.5 percent of the vote, according to [preliminary results carried by public broadcaster ARD](https://www.tagesschau.de/wahl/archiv/2025-02-23-BT-DE/index-content.shtml).
The far-right Alternative for Germany ([AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany)) followed with 20.8 percent – doubling its support compared to the previous election. In third place, Olaf Scholz's [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) suffered major losses, scoring 16.4 percent. They were followed by the [Green Party](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/green-party) (11.6%) and the [Left Party](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/left-party) (8.75%).
Uncertainty abounded when polling agencies published their first projections, as it was unclear whether the pro-business Free Democrats ([FDP](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/fdp-free-democratic-party)) and the left-wing anti-immigrant and pro-Russia Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance ([BSW](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bsw-sahra-wagenknecht-alliance)) would clear the five percent threshold to make it into parliament. This, in turn, would have had a huge impact on whether a two-party coalition was possible, or whether a three-party coalition was necessary to achieve a parliamentary majority.
In the end, neither party cleared the threshold (4.9% for the [BSW](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bsw-sahra-wagenknecht-alliance) and 4.3% for the [FDP](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/fdp-free-democratic-party)), meaning that the [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) can secure a majority government by forming a coalition with the [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) without having to rely on other parties.
Coalition negotiations [can take weeks or even months](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/long-road-new-government-coalition-germany). Germany is unlikely to have a new government before late spring 2025, but [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union) leader Merz signalled he aims for a speedy conclusion of coalition negotiations.

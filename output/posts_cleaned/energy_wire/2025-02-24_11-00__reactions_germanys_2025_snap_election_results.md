# Vote25: Reactions to Germany's snap election results
German businesses, researchers and civil society have called for speedy coalition negotiations following the country's snap elections on 23 February. Planning security and clarity are essential in view of the stagnating economy and to secure the future competitiveness of the country, as well as to answer new geopolitical challenges, industry representatives said. The next German government should continue to resolutely pursue its energy transition and unlock much-needed future investments, analysts argued. [UPDATE: Adds several reactions]
**Renewable energy federation[BEE](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bee-german-renewable-energy-federation):**
“In view of the numerous pressing tasks for the continuation of the energy transition and securing a climate-neutral business location, exploratory talks and coalition negotiations must deliver results quickly - also against the backdrop of new European and geopolitical challenges. The aim is to form a stable and effective government that sets a clear course for the expansion of renewable energies in all industries and sectors,” said the association’s head Simone Peter. “Although climate protection did not play a central role in the election campaign, it remains a key factor for the country's economic future. Companies urgently need planning security in order to be able to fulfil national targets and compete internationally for climate technologies.”
**Industry association[BDI](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bdi-federation-german-industries):**
"The backlog of decisions and actions in many issues that are essential for the economy - such as reducing bureaucracy, government investment, energy supply and security policy - must be resolved as a matter of urgency," said [BDI](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bdi-federation-german-industries) head Peter Leibinger. "Germany needs a courageous growth program that will powerfully advance our country. There is no time for tactical games and formulaic compromises.  
"Everything that creates growth must now be the focus. A trend reversal can only be achieved through a package of measures: public investment in modern infrastructure, in transformation and in the resilience of our economy. Timely signals of relief in the energy sector through quick decisions on the power plant strategy and lasting relief on [grid fees](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_g#grid_fees) and electricity tax. [...] The new federal government must have a strong voice in Europe. Germany depends on European unity, common economic strength and a competitive EU."
**Utility association[BDEW](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bdew-german-association-energy-and-water-industries):**
“A stable government must be formed quickly and the ability to act must be established,” said association head Kerstin Andreae. “The benchmark for energy policy decisions must be ambitious feasibility. In principle, the implementation of the energy transition will take decades. To achieve this, we need a consistent and reliable regulatory framework that is not orientated towards legislative periods, but rather continues to develop the energy transition and keeps an eye on security of supply […] Central projects for restructuring the electricity market, but also for the heating transition and for the ramp-up of the hydrogen economy are in the middle of the process and must not be allowed to stall.”

"In view of the numerous political and economic crises, Germany must become capable of acting as quickly as possible. Germany now needs a genuine reform coalition - and a return to substantive policy after the heated debates," said the association's director Joachim Bühler. "Security, competitiveness and innovation must now have priority. In terms of economic policy, Germany must take a leading role in the growth markets of digitisation and cleantech."
**Trade union[IG Metall](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/ig-metall-industrial-union-metalworkers)**
"Industry and employees cannot wait months for clear perspectives. They need concrete commitments as quickly as possible," said [IG Metall](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/ig-metall-industrial-union-metalworkers) chairwoman Christiane Benner. According to Germany's largest trade union, the next federal government should focus on competitive energy costs, the ramp-up of electric mobility and comprehensive investments in education, roads, railways and digitalisation, business weekly WirtschaftWoche [reported](https://www.wiwo.de/politik/deutschland/bundestagswahl-2025-so-reagiert-die-wirtschaft-auf-das-wahlergebnis/30226212.html).
**Energy transition think tank[Agora Energiewende](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/agora-energiewende):**
“Germany is facing a significantly changed world situation. Increasing geopolitical tensions, trade conflicts and a worsening climate crisis require decisive action from the future German government and from all parties represented in parliament in order to strengthen stability and resilience. A strategically smart and socially balanced climate policy in Germany and Europe is the key to this,” said the think tank’s head Markus Steigenberger. “The core of such a climate policy must therefore be to continue the great successes in the expansion of renewable energies and at the same time accelerate the transformation of industry, buildings and transport. On the one hand, this requires a solid financial basis in order to modernise public infrastructure, stimulate private investment and support companies and private households in the transition to climate neutrality. On the other hand, it is important to consistently implement the Green Deal together with European partners. On this basis, Germany and Europe can continue to play a strong role in international climate protection.”
**Climate change think tank[E3G](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/e3g-third-generation-environmentalism): **
Germany’s next coalition government needs to be formed quickly, also to send the right signals to the international community, said Marc Weissgerber, head of the think tank’s Berlin office. The climate law’s target of climate neutrality by 2045 must be “a clear guideline for the new government,” no matter which parties form a coalition, he said. Germany needs to invest more in its infrastructure, which could require a reform of the country’s debt limit rules, or setting up a special fund, he told Clean Energy Wire.
“At EU level, the German government must actively support the Clean Industrial Deal in particular.” At the international level, the next government would have to signal quickly that Germany will maintain and expand its pioneering role in climate negotiations, says Weissgerber. “This is essential in response to the Trump administration.” The government should take on a leading role in preparations for the next UN climate conference COP30 in Brazil.
**Jana Puglierin, think tank ECFR**
"Yesterday's election result was good news for Europe. Friedrich Merz has the opportunity to form a stable coalition with the [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party). He has repeatedly emphasised that he sees Germany as a leading power in Europe and has already established close contacts with the Polish, French and other European governments during the campaign. He seems to recognise the scale of the challenges and sees Germany as a key state in meeting them. It is important that he now succeeds in mobilising the financial resources for a strong German security and defence policy"
****Arne Jungjohann** , political scientist at the Green Academy:**
"This result is a mixed bag. The gains of the far right and its ongoing normalisation are worrisome," political scientist Arne Jungjohann said. "The campaign is over. Now it is time to act. Germans across party lines demand solutions for real problems, such as lowering high rents, investing in public infrastructure, and tackling the climate crisis. The democratic parties should act swiftly and form a new coalition, based on middle ground and compromises."
**European think tank Strategic Perspectives**
"Germany can address the concerns over the US and China only through European solutions; the EU needs an operational German government quickly to strengthen its negotiation power," said the think tank's director Linda Kalcher. "The future government will need to address energy prices, industrial competitiveness, shortfalls in infrastructure and digitalisation as well as citizens’ concerns over the education and pension systems. A big debate will thus emerge on Germany’s debt brake and how it relates to joint European spending on industry and defence. Any adjustments to the debt brake will also require a two-thirds majority - thus an involvement of the Greens and the Left which won’t be easy to achieve."
**Christoph Bals, policy director at[Germanwatch](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/germanwatch)**
"These are extremely challenging times in terms of foreign and domestic policy. We now need a stable and constructive government with a clear compass for the major challenges: for a Europe that defends human dignity for all, the strength of the law against the law of the strongest and the protection of the ecological foundations of life. EU security cannot be achieved by military means alone. What is needed is an effective humanitarian security strategy that also takes into account the greatest long-term dangers resulting from the climate crisis. A strong national and international climate, biodiversity and health policy and corresponding international rules and partnerships are central to this. It also serves the competitiveness of the economy if the country drives forward the necessary transition to climate neutrality and tackles this effectively, fairly and affordably for all."
**Environmental group[NABU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/nabu-nature-and-biodiversity-conservation-union):**
"Given the difficult majority situation, the formation of a government will not be a foregone conclusion," said [NABU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/nabu-nature-and-biodiversity-conservation-union) head Andreas Krüger. "The future partners will have to find joint answers to the pressing crises, which they will then also implement. Above all, the much-cited economic competence will now be determined by whether nature is also taken seriously as a location factor. Our country can only be successful in the long term if ecology and economy go hand in hand."
**Youth climate movement Fridays for Future:**
“The climate crisis is and remains the most pressing crisis of our time. The fact that it was suppressed and minimised in this election campaign for tactical reasons was wrong and irresponsible,” said spokesperson Pauline Brünger. “The next parliamentary term will decide whether we can still prevent the worst consequences of the climate crisis. We can only hope that the [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) is also aware of this responsibility […] The majority of voters across the entire democratic party spectrum want more climate protection. In order for this majority to remain, the new government has a responsibility to repeatedly convince voters of the benefits of climate protection with a strong emphasis on social aspects.” Spokesperson Carla Reemtsma added: “The backtracking announced by the [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) on the phase-out of combustion engines, the heating transition and the [coal phase-out](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_c#coal_phase-out) is a direct attack on the [Paris Climate Agreement](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_p#paris_climate_agreement) and Germany's climate policy responsibility in the world. We expect the new government to tackle the climate crisis with clear measures.”
**Environmental NGO Friends of the Earth Germany ([BUND](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bund-friends-earth-germany))**
"It is now up to the government [that Friedrich Merz] will lead whether our country consistently promotes climate and nature conservation. Important steps for the preservation of our livelihoods are clear: the consistent and nature-friendly expansion of renewable energies, the restoration of natural habitats and the decisive approach to a socially just heating transition," said [BUND](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bund-friends-earth-germany) head Verena Graichen. "To enable investment in the future, the debt brake must be reformed. [BUND](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bund-friends-earth-germany) will judge the new government primarily by its efforts to achieve socially just environmental, climate and nature conservation, and will follow the work of the new government with critical but constructive support."

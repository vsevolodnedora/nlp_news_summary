# Prospective new German government shows no ambition to speed up coal exit
[Politics](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/topics/Politics)
Germany's prospective next government is stepping back from its predecessor's ambition to speed up the country’s [coal exit](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_c#coal_exit) to 2030, sticking instead to the original 2038 deadline. Leaked negotiation documents reveal that many climate and energy policies remain contested in the ongoing coalition negotiations between conservatives and Social Democrats. Environmentalists warned that the provisional agreements could result in a "massive step backwards" for climate protection not only in Germany but also in Europe. [UPDATE: Adds further reactions]
Germany's prospective new coalition government does not want to pursue the outgoing government's aspiration to pull the country's [coal exit](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_c#coal_exit) forward to 2030 from the official 2038 deadline. In leaked documents summarising provisional agreements between the conservative [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) alliance and the Social Democrats ([SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party)), the parties said "we are sticking to the agreed phase-out path for [lignite](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_l#lignite)-based electricity generation by 2038 at the latest."
The outgoing coalition government had originally said it wanted to pull the exit forward, "ideally" to 2030. This date is not mentioned in the provisional agreements.
The conservatives and the [SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party) are in the midst of formal coalition negotiations, and the leaked paper summarised preliminary agreements reached in the first round of talks, which will now be discussed in more detail by senior party leaders in the "core negotiating group", which could still result in major changes. Many of the proposals also still depend on financing.
The draft texts agreed in multiple topic-specific working groups – which include [climate and energy](https://briefing.table.media/r/lzYhSWc230969ms1902.html), and [transport, infrastructure and construction](https://briefing.table.media/r/lzYhSWc230970ms1902.html) – are meant to form the basis for a formal coalition agreement, which the parties aim to present in April or May at the latest.
The draft shows that the parties plan to remain committed to Germany's climate targets, including the goal of making the entire country climate neutral by 2045. However, the document also revealed that many issues, including the introduction of a speed limit, the deconstruction of decommissioned nuclear power plants, as well as the use of carbon capture in all industrial sectors, remain contentious, according to media reports.
In a first round of exploratory coalition talks, which preceded the current formal negotiations, the parties had already agreed on expanding renewables, reducing electricity prices for industry and households, and building 20 gigawatts (GW) of gas-fired power plants to serve as backup capacity in an electricity system based on renewables. These agreements are mirrored in the negotiation papers. [See our factsheet on the results of the exploratory talks [here](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/qa-first-climate-and-energy-proposals-germanys-future-coalition-government)].
Here is a brief overview of preliminary agreements contained in the leaked documents:
**Energy**


**Industry**


**Heating**


**Transport**


**Society**


**Emissions trading**


Climate action advocates warned the provisional results could result in a large setback for the country’s emission-cutting plans. “Apart from some good ideas, we see several massive blind spots and real dangers for climate policy in this text,” said Christoph Bals, policy director at environment and development NGO [Germanwatch](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/germanwatch). “If these passages were to be included in the coalition agreement, there would be a massive step backwards in climate protection and the future-proof modernisation of our country.”
In particular, [Germanwatch](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/germanwatch) criticised what it said was an “attempt by the [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) in the negotiations to achieve part of the German and European climate targets through questionable CO2 credits from other countries without limits.” It added this approach would not only move Germany and the EU away from the goal of meeting climate protection targets at home, but also undermine the necessary innovation incentives. “Shifting our own responsibility onto other countries would be unfair,” Bals said. His NGO welcomed the support promised in the draft text for EU [emissions trading](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_e#emissions_trading) for building and transport emissions from 2027, but said accompanying climate protection measures were insufficient.
Electricity company Octopus said it was “obvious that climate protection will now take a back seat to goals such as security of supply and affordability,” adding that an agreement on a “grid-friendly” renewables rollout “could become a hidden brake on expansion”. The company also saw a lack of measures to achieve the overarching target of a cost-efficient and sustainable energy system, and said the aspiring coalition partners were planning an “outsized” addition of gas power plants.
Renewable energy association [BEE](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bee-german-renewable-energy-federation) said that the results of the negotiations [pointed in the right direction](https://www.bee-ev.de/service/pressemitteilungen/beitrag/bee-erstbewertung-des-papiers-der-ag-klima-investitionssicherheit-erhalten), but was [particularly critical](https://www.presseportal.de/pm/51135/5999804) of possible plans to abolish Germany's "heating law", legislation to gradually phase out oil and gas boilers. "We are very critical of the fact that its abolition is now being demanded again," said [BEE](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bee-german-renewable-energy-federation) head Simone Peter. "SMEs have already invested large sums in the production of renewable heating technologies, citizens have been looking at alternatives to fossil-fuelled heating […] and need guidance for replacing heating systems without zigzagging […]"
This warning against plans to abolish the "heating law" was [echoed by six environmental associations](https://www.dnr.de/publikationen/offener-brief-die-waermewende-nicht-abwuergen), including the umbrella organisation DNR, [Greenpeace](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/greenpeace-germany), [WWF](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/wwf-germany) Germany and [Germanwatch](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/germanwatch). "Even today, the existing measures are not sufficient to achieve the climate targets in the building sector – we simply cannot afford to go backwards," said DNR political director Tobias Pforte-von Randow. "Abolishing the law would not only lead to massive uncertainty, but would also further cement dependencies on fossil fuels."
Green transport association VCD welcomed the planned expansion of rail infrastructure and the continuation of the "Germany ticket", but [lamented](https://www.vcd.org/service/presse/pressemitteilungen/vcd-zum-schwarz-roten-verkehrspapier) plans to reduce air traffic tax, ambiguity on funding for public transport, and the lack of agreement to implement a speed limit on Germany's motorways. "It was already clear from the exploratory paper that hardly any major leaps in transport and climate policy can be expected from the coalition government," said VCD chairwoman Kerstin Haarmann. "Walking and cycling are neglected in the paper."
The economic think tank Forum Ökologisch-Soziale Marktwirtschaft ([FÖS](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/fos-green-budget-germany)) [was critical](https://crm.foes.de/civicrm/mailing/view?id=2910) of the preliminary agreements, saying they did not represent increased climate ambition. "The reintroduction of the energy tax reduction for agricultural diesel, the increase in the commuter allowance and the reduction in aviation taxes are not a boost for climate protection, but rather a brake on it," said executive director Carolin Schenuit.
The green economic think tank was particularly critical of planned reductions in electricity prices for only benefitting households with high consumption; of the idea of not including emissions from agriculture in [emissions trading](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_e#emissions_trading); and of the potential excuse for delays in renewable power expansion by requiring new capacity to be grid-friendly.
Julia Verlinden, [Green Party](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/green-party) member of parliament, [said](https://www.gruene-bundestag.de/presse/default-4ef65d4fb6/berichterstattung-ueber-die-ergebnisse-der-arbeitsgruppen-der-schwarz-roten-koalitionsverhandlungen/) that the interim coalition negotiation results "show that combating the climate and biodiversity crisis is not an urgent concern" for the negotiating parties.

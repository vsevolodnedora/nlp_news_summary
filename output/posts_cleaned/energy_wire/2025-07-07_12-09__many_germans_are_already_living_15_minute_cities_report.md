# Many Germans are already living in 15-minute cities – report

The majority of the population in Germany's cities can already access most daily services within a 15-minute walk or bike ride, according to a [report](https://www.bbsr.bund.de/BBSR/DE/veroeffentlichungen/bbsr-online/2025/bbsr-online-027-2025.html "https://www.bbsr.bund.de/BBSR/DE/veroeffentlichungen/bbsr-online/2025/bbsr-online-027-2025.html") by the Federal Institute for Research on Building, Urban Affairs and Spatial Development ([BBSR](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/federal-institute-research-building-urban-affairs-and-spatial-development)). The researchers said that the ‘15-minute city’ – a concept from urban planning to promote sustainable transport in cities by reducing the distances people need to travel to reach key services such as shops and schools – is much more common across German cities of all sizes than previously thought.
The report assessed access to 24 key destinations like doctors, supermarkets, and public transport, using a detailed accessibility index that even factored in the walking speeds of children and older adults. The analysis found that around 2,100 cities and municipalities in Germany can be classified as 15-minute cities or better. The researchers also found that, on average, residents can reach three-quarters of these facilities within 15 minutes, with the best designed urban areas providing services six to eight minutes away. "It is a widespread misconception that only large cities or trendy start-up districts offer short distances," said Brigitte Adam, [BBSR](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/federal-institute-research-building-urban-affairs-and-spatial-development) project manager. "Our data shows that functionally mixed neighbourhoods with short distances are also possible in large housing estates or garden cities."
"If we want people to walk or cycle more often in their everyday lives, we must consistently improve the conditions for doing so," Adam added. Her team’s research provided recommendations for promoting sustainable urban development: boosting mixed-use development, upgrading bike and pedestrian infrastructure, and fostering public engagement. No sweeping legal reforms are needed; instead, cities can act now within existing frameworks, the authors noted. “The 15-minute city isn’t a utopia,” Adam notes, “it’s a practical guide to making cities greener, healthier, and more liveable — today.”

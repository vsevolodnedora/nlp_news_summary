# NGOs call for clear stance against Russian gas supplies by next German government
## 
Clean Energy Wire
Several environmental and political NGOs have called on Germany’s new government to force state-owned gas company SEFE to halt purchases of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) and make a clear stand against the possibility of bringing the controversial Nord Stream pipelines online again.
In [a joint letter](https://www.duh.de/fileadmin/user_upload/download/Pressemitteilungen/Energie/250505_Merz-Brief_Russland_final.pdf), they addressed incoming chancellor Friedrich Merz and asked him to “put an end to all efforts to make Germany dependent on Russian gas supplies again”. Together with European partner countries such as Poland and the Baltic states, Merz should “stand by Ukraine and take a clear stance against the commissioning of the [Nord Stream 2](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_n#nord_stream_2) pipeline”, wrote Environmental Action Germany ([DUH](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/duh-environmental-action-germany)) and several other organisations.
Germany [rejects the direct import](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/germany-tells-ports-reject-russian-gas-cargoes-ft-reports-2024-11-14/) of Russian LNG at the three domestic terminals, but the nationalised gas importer and trader SEFE – which formerly belonged to Russian Gazprom – still has a [long-term contract](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russia-extends-permit-lng-supplies-germanys-sefe-until-2040-2024-02-09/) for deliveries from the Russian Yamal LNG plant. Much of the gas [has arrived](https://background.tagesspiegel.de/energie-und-klima/briefing/deutschland-kommt-nicht-los-vom-russischen-gas) at the French Dunkirk import terminal and either been transported onwards or fed into the European grid. SEFE has said that it does not directly sell Russian deliveries to Germany.
After sabotage in [2022 destroyed three lines of the Nord Stream](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/gas-pipeline-nord-stream-2-links-germany-russia-splits-europe) gas pipelines which directly connect Russia to Germany, media recently reported that the projects could make a comeback as part of efforts to end the war in Ukraine. Until now, the German government has said it is continuing its policy of independence from Russian energy deliveries. The European Commission is [set to present a plan tomorrow](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/whats-next-europe-timeline-european-climate-and-energy-policy) (6 May) with more detailed proposals on how to end Russian energy imports by 2027.

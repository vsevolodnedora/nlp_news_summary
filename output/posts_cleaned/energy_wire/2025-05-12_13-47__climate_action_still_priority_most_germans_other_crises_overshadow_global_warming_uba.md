# Climate action still a priority for most Germans as other crises overshadow global warming – UBA

Most people in Germany continue to be very concerned about the impact of global warming and support climate action measures to mitigate its damaging effects despite the many other crises in the world overshadowing climate in recent years, an [analysis](https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/studie-umweltbewusstsein-vielfaeltige-krisen) by the Federal Environment Agency ([UBA](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/uba-federal-environment-agency)) has found. “Many citizens feel that the situation in the health or education sectors, economic development as well as domestic security and international wars are more urgent,” the [UBA](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/uba-federal-environment-agency) said in its Environmental Consciousness Report. “However, viewed individually [rather than in comparison to other concerns], concerns about specific environmental challenges remain at a high level and partly even are gaining in relevance,” the state agency added.
More than half (54%) said environmental and climate action are “very important,” down from 57 percent in 2022 and even 65 percent in 2020. About one-third believed that climate change can still be effectively countered, the worst ratio since 2002, the [UBA](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/uba-federal-environment-agency) added. Most also said [that climate adaptation measures are indispensable](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/dossiers/ill-equipped-europe-braces-impact-rising-temperatures). Two-thirds said that increasing periods of extreme heat are already threatening their health, with 85 percent supporting better protection measures against heat waves. Eighty percent said they are content with the state of nature and access to green spaces in their vicinity. On the other hand, only seven percent said the global environment is in a healthy state.
Among the environmental challenges that were given a higher priority compared to previous analyses were plastic pollution, species loss, the safe [storage](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_s#storage) of nuclear waste and the protection of ecosystems. The most popular measures identified to improve the environment were lowering air pollution and better access to public transport systems. However, the [UBA](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/uba-federal-environment-agency) added that the urgency of perceived threats by citizens are often at odds with the scientific consensus. Especially the [connection between biodiversity and climate change](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/un-biodiversity-cop-enormous-step-combines-climate-and-environment-policies-says-germany), and [the impact it has on agriculture and food supply](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/eu-climate-policy-must-put-more-focus-food-security-german-farmers) are underestimated by many citizens, the agency said. [UBA](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/uba-federal-environment-agency) surveyed over 2,500 people between September and November 2024.

# Dispatch from Italy | May '25
Italy is facing a delay in the phase-out of coal, as the future of a major coal-fired power plant near Rome remains unclear, despite plans for its closure by the end of the year. The uncertainty is partly fuelled by industry concerns about high energy prices. Businesses have said the latest legislative package, designed to help lower household energy bills through targeted incentives, is insufficient. At the same time, experts have warned that growing dependence on US fossil fuels could slow down the energy transition in Europe and Italy. Nonetheless, the rollout of renewables in Italy continues apace, thanks to faster permitting processes and new incentives for energy communities, even if regional disparities remain. Rising living costs, combined with extreme weather events and clashes with the police, have intensified climate protests in the country.

[On the research front](https://www.igg.cnr.it/ricerche/progetti-finanziati/geco), the Institute of Geosciences and Geo-resources (IGG-CNR) has been developing mineral carbonation technology as part of[ the EU-funded GECO project](https://geco-h2020.eu/). The technology captures CO2 from the exhaust gases emitted by geothermal power plants via a chemical reaction and permanently stores it underground. The project aims to set up a pilot plant at industrial scale, [potentially creating an Italian CCS supply chain](https://www.lescienze.it/news/2025/03/17/news/italia_cattura_carbonio-18692361/).

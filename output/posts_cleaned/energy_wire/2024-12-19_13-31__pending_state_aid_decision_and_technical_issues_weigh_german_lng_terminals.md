# Pending state aid decision and technical issues weigh on German LNG terminals

Table Media
Germany’s [LNG import terminals](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/liquefied-gas-does-lng-have-place-germanys-energy-future) are under pressure as technical issues and a wait for approval from the European Commission regarding state aid could lead to months-long disruptions, [reported news service Table Media](https://table.media/berlin/analyse/energieversorgung-warum-die-lng-terminals-nach-starkem-start-jetzt-schwaecheln/).
As the state-owned company Deutsche Energy Terminal GmbH (DET) operates two existing and two planned terminals, the Commission has to give authorisation under state aid rules. The first approval expires at the end of this year and a new one has not yet been granted by the EU, the German economy ministry told Table Media. The wait for the green light could be a long one, the news service wrote.
DET had previously stated on the European [transparency platform ALSI](https://alsi.gie.eu/) that the terminal in Wilhelmshaven would not be available in the first four months of 2025. There were also rumours that the second terminal in Brunsbüttel would not be operational next year, wrote Table Media.
Technical hurdles also prevent two additional LNG terminals (Stade and Wilhelmshaven 2) from starting operations, and the controversial DET-operated terminal on the Baltic Sea island Rügen requires a new state permit to continue operations. However, the economy ministry told Table Media that, in case of an emergency, the terminals are ready to be used.
Germany’s [gas storage level is currently at around 80 percent](https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/DE/Gasversorgung/aktuelle_gasversorgung/start.html) and supply is “stable”, said the Federal Network Agency ([BNetzA](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/federal-network-agency-electricity-gas-telecommunications-post-and-railway-0)). It said that it is closely monitoring international developments regarding gas supplies from Russia to Austria and the expected end of gas transit through Ukraine, and does not currently expect any disruption to the German gas supply.

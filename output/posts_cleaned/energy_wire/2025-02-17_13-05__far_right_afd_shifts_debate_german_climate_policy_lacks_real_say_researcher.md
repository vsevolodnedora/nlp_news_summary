The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) – the second strongest polling party ahead of Germany's snap elections on 23 February – is the only major party to outright reject the scientific consensus behind human-induced climate change. The AfD will likely remain in opposition for the coming term, yet the party's growing strength has influenced the electoral campaign through agenda-setting, says political scientist Manès Weisskircher. While some of their anti-climate protection messages have found support in the wider population, their fundamental criticism of climate action relies on exaggerated claims and leaves nuance out of complicated policy decisions, the researcher who focuses on far-right politics and climate protection at TU Dresden told Clean Energy Wire. Still, a growing support base means other mainstream parties might turn quieter on their climate ambition, Weisskircher warned.

**Clean Energy Wire: The far-right has entered governments in a handful of European countries. Do you see any chance that the[AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) becomes part of Germany’s government either immediately after the election or in the coming year? **

Manès Weisskircher: In western Europe, the case of Germany is still quite exceptional: while in many other countries the conservatives have been open to [forming coalitions with the far-right](https://www.politico.eu/article/mapped-europe-far-right-government-power-politics-eu-italy-finalnd-hungary-parties-elections-polling/), the [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) alliance – which comfortably leads in the polls – rules this out. So does every other major party. Even in their stronghold regions in eastern Germany, the [AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) did not come close to government involvement [in the regional elections last autumn](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/dossiers/legacy-east-west-divide-lives-germanys-climate-and-energy-debate).
The [AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) will likely continue to remain an opposition party after the federal election – Germany’s conservatives will find other majorities to form a government. Whether the [AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) will stay distant from government power five or ten years from now is impossible to tell.
**The[AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) has been in federal parliament since 2017 and is the only bigger party to flat out reject the science around human-induced climate change and the need for emissions reduction. Over the past eight years as an opposition faction, did the [AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) have any significant influence on climate policy decisions in the Bundestag?**
The [AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) is a party without direct influence in parliament. Typically, the German parliament is marked by stable government-opposition dynamics, and the [AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) is an opposition party that other parties do not want to cooperate with, given the party’s far-right stances and radical rhetoric.
At the moment, however, after the [breakdown of the SPD-led three](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/qa-what-does-german-coalition-government-breakup-mean-climate-and-energy)-party coalition but ahead of [February’s federal election](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/long-road-new-government-coalition-germany), parliamentary majorities are less stable. This is why the [AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) [managed to be pivotal in one vote](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/29/german-immigration-motion-passes-breaking-taboo-on-cooperation-with-afd) in January, providing support for a [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union) resolution – not a law – on immigration. But this was the exception to the rule. At the federal level, no such thing has happened in the context of climate action.
**Migration has been the[AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany)'s biggest talking point, and the party looks to have been successful in pushing other parties to work for stricter policy. Is this also the case for climate ambition? Has the [AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) succeeded in weakening efforts in Germany, also on a regional and local level?**
Pursuing effective climate action is very challenging due to the extent of the problem, the many stakeholders involved, business interests, consumer habits, inherent uncertainties, and the short-term costs required for long-term benefits.
[AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) critique is relying on exaggerated claims and heavy language instead of a nuanced criticism of complex policy decisions.

[AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) opposition [is often additional sand in the gears](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/populist-afd-sand-gears-german-climate-efforts). Importantly, the [AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) has impacted public discourse by framing climate action as too far-reaching or as mainly ‘ideological’ instead of ‘rational’ – [AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) critique is relying on exaggerated claims and heavy language instead of a nuanced criticism of complex policy decisions. One example for this is the [party’s opposition](https://www.politico.eu/article/robert-lambrou-alternative-for-germany-heat-pump-election-climate-change/) to the ‘[heating law](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/qa-germany-debates-phaseout-fossil-fuel-heating-systems)’ in 2023 – the outgoing government's move to gradually phase out fossil fuel-run boilers.
The [AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) has also affected climate action at the regional and local levels. For example, wind power expansion has long been heavily criticised by the party at the subnational level, with mainstream parties often turning quieter about the need for expansion. In the state of Thuringia, an [AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) stronghold, the party provided decisive support to the [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union) and the pro-business Free Democrats ([FDP](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/fdp-free-democratic-party)) in a vote effectively banning wind power in forests – which is a contested measure also among some environmental organisations because of the conflict between climate action and local environmental protection.
The strength of the [AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) allows it to shape the current electoral campaign mainly through agenda-setting.

**What about the current election campaign: has the[AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) put a focus on climate policy and if so, to what purpose? Or are their anti-migration positions so loud that they drown out the climate debate?**
Climate change is not a particularly salient issue in the current campaign. Environmental and climate NGOs have a hard time receiving political attention for their demands. Still, the energy transition is an important subject in the current debates about the economy. The [AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) continues to oppose the energy transition, pointing to economic stagnation and the [problems of the car industry](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/vote25-transport-transition-poses-policy-conundrum-next-german-government), for example. It portrays the shift towards renewables as the root of all economic problems. The issue of immigration, however, is the focus of this year’s [AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) campaign.
**Do you expect the[AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) to leave any kind of mark on the next coalition treaty, or to influence the public debate in such a way that it pushes the governing parties to weaken their climate policies and positions?**
For sure, the strength of the [AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) – it is currently Germany's second strongest party in polls – allows it to shape the current electoral campaign mainly through agenda-setting and because of the strong political focus on the previously-mentioned joint vote of [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union) and [AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) in parliament. As a result, the [AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) benefits from significant political attention and successfully directs focus to its core issues, especially anti-immigration politics.
Given the mainstream parties' rejection of forming coalitions with the [AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany), it will not directly affect the coalition negotiations.
Manès Weisskircher, TU Dresden
This also affects the political competitors, especially the positions of the [CDU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/cdu-christian-democratic-union)/[CSU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/csu-christian-social-union), which tries to attract a broad church of centrist and right-wing voters. From such a perspective, the [AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) has indirect influence. But given the mainstream parties' rejection of forming coalitions with the [AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany), it will not directly affect the coalition negotiations.
**Looking at the next four years and a projected stronger[AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) faction in parliament, is Germany’s climate policy at risk?**
The AfD’s strategic opposition to any new climate policy measures will certainly be a challenge for effective climate action in Germany. However, it is far from the only challenge in times of economic stagnation, with [many jobs in industry at risk](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/vote25-next-german-government-must-reconcile-industrial-decarbonisation-and-competitiveness).
Perhaps the most positive aspect is that we can continue to expect political commitment to the [decarbonisation](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_d#decarbonisation) of the economy, the expansion of renewable energy and the already agreed-upon phase-out of coal.
**The party is currently polling around 20 percent across Germany. Does this imply that a large share of German voters questions the need for climate action? What messages resonate and why?**
Importantly, what resonates most is the AfD’s opposition to concrete measures, such as the expansion of wind power or the ‘heating law.’ The AfD’s positions also find support among sympathisers of other parties. The same is true for the party’s massive attacks on [climate protests by the activist group Last Generation](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/dossiers/youth-climate-movement-pushes-germany-step-ambition). What doesn’t resonate as much is the AfD’s explicit denial of human-made climate change – a fringe position in German society that, according to survey data, is not even a consensual stance among [AfD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/afd-alternative-germany) supporters.

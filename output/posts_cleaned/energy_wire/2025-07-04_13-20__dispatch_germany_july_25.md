Two months after the new government entered office, climate action proponents are becoming increasingly concerned about the future direction of energy policy in Germany. Activists have accused the economy minister of planning to slow the rollout of wind and solar energies with an ill-designed assessment of the country’s landmark energy transition. The government’s decision to deny households and small businesses a promised electricity tax cut was met with even broader criticism by consumer groups and trade associations.

Stories to watch in the weeks ahead
Climate policy advocates and the renewables industry fear that the monitoring could result in a significant slowdown in the rollout of renewables, given that economy minister Katherina Reiche recently [told](https://x.com/sven_giegold/status/1938144021609910643) an industry conference that renewable targets were “completely exaggerated.” Further fanning these concerns is that Reiche commissioned the report from the [EWI](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/ewi-institute-energy-economics-university-cologne) institute, which [has been accused](https://lobbypedia.de/wiki/Energiewirtschaftliches_institut) of having close ties to the fossil fuel industry. NGO Environmental Action Germany ([DUH](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/duh-environmental-action-germany)) said the process was [designed to serve as a pretext to slow renewables](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/critics-warn-germanys-energy-transition-reality-check-designed-slow-renewables).  
Climate action proponents have argued that slowing the rollout of renewables due to lower electricity consumption or lagging grid expansion misses the point, because the real problem lies in the government’s failure to switch to climate-friendly technologies such as heat pumps and electric cars. The government’s [approval of a joint gas extraction project with the Netherlands](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/germany-agrees-joint-gas-extraction-project-netherlands-wadden-sea) in an ecologically sensitive region of the North Sea also caused alarm among advocates of ambitious climate policies.
Germany’s buildings and construction minister Verena Hubertz [told CLEW](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/national-co2-price-sets-germany-new-eu-emissions-trading-system-buildings-minister) that Germany is well positioned to smoothly transition to the [ETS](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_e#ets) 2, given that it is one of few European countries that already has a national price for emissions from the heating and transport sectors. Fittingly, Germany’s environment minister Carsten Schneider [recently singled out](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/social-justice-key-climate-battleground-ten-years-after-paris-agreement-german-env-min) the “social question” as a key battleground for climate policy – so watch this space.

# Next German govt must continue decarbonisation of heating – industry alliance

Clean Energy Wire 
Germany’s next coalition government should push to decarbonise the country’s heating systems, said a wide alliance of sector associations in [a joint appeal](https://www.bdew.de/media/documents/2025-02-20_Appell_Zukunft_W%C3%A4rme_FINAL.pdf). The organisations called for “clarity”, “reliability” and “a coherent strategy for a sustainable heat supply,” to ensure that people, heating sector businesses and the energy industry have planning and investment security.
The alliance included energy industry association [BDEW](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bdew-german-association-energy-and-water-industries), the Federation of German Heating Industry ([BDH](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/bdh-federation-german-heating-industry)) and the German Association of Local Utilities ([VKU](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/vku-german-association-local-utilities)), among others. The organisations said that more than half of final energy use in Germany went towards heating buildings and industrial processes, so a climate-neutral heat supply is crucial for meeting climate targets.
“The switch to a climate-neutral heat supply and the associated CO2 reductions represent one of the greatest social and economic challenges of our time,” said the appeal. They called for a reform of the Building Energy Act – which in part stipulates the move to cleaner modes of heating – to lower bureaucracy and create “understandable requirements for building owners.”
Intense debates over the [controversial law](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/qa-germany-debates-phaseout-fossil-fuel-heating-systems) to help transition away from fossil fuel sources of heating [shaped the last legislative period](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/public-discontent-government-risks-slowing-germanys-climate-efforts) and campaigns leading up to Germany’s snap election on 23 February. The Building Energy Act needs to be reformed in any case, said the organisations, as [new EU rules](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_24_1966) must be translated into national law.
[Cutting heating emissions has become urgent](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/vote25-analysis-germany-buildings-heating-transition-next-german-government) – Germany is already set to miss the corresponding 2030 climate targets as it continues to rely on fossil fuel boilers, while energy-saving renovations proceed at a glacial pace.

Germany’s new government will present a comprehensive programme of measures to put the country on track to reaching climate targets by the end of 2025, the new environment and climate minister Carsten Schneider said in [a first speech in parliament](https://dbtg.tv/cvid/7631300).
A [fresh report by the country’s key climate policy advisors](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/germany-runs-risk-missing-emission-cutting-targets-new-government-plans-climate-council) – the [Council of Experts on Climate Change](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/council-experts-climate-change-germany) –once again highlighted shortfalls in climate action especially in the transport and building sectors, as well as in Germany’s forests and wetlands, which had to be addressed. “I will therefore immediately get to work on the 2025 climate action programme, which we need to adopt by the end of this year,” said Schneider. Ensuring a just transition through policies that support especially lower income households would be of particular importance.
The government is legally [required](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/ksg/BJNR251310019.html#BJNR251310019BJNG000300000) to present a programme of measures in all sectors to ensure that the 2030 and 2040 [greenhouse gas](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_g#greenhouse_gas) emissions reduction targets are met. It must decide on the programme by March 2026 at the latest, but the new minister aims to agree it sooner.
Schneider emphasised that environment and nature also play a part in Germany’s national security. “Today, a secure supply of drinking water and food, a climate-resilient infrastructure and the energy supply are also part of our security and must be protected in particular,” he said.
The new minister from the Social Democrats ([SPD](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/spd-social-democratic-party)) said he would focus on an intensive exchange among all stakeholders, highlighting common ground. While Schneider – the former minister of state for Eastern Germany – does not have much background in climate policy, [his experience in navigating political divide](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/designated-german-climate-minister-could-push-transition-experience-bridging-political-divide) in the country’s east and its population’s fatigue of constant changes could help him advance the transition towards net zero.

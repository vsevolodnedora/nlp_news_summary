Millions of residents in Germany’s cities are being exposed to moderate or extreme heat stress caused by high temperatures, dense surface sealing and too little greenery, according to the [second "heat check"](https://www.duh.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/pressemitteilung/zweiter-hitze-check-der-deutschen-umwelthilfe-mehr-als-12-millionen-menschen-in-deutschen-staedten-v/) of NGO Environmental Action Germany ([DUH](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/duh-environmental-action-germany)). Over 12 million people in 190 cities with over 50,000 residents live in high-heat areas, [DUH](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/duh-environmental-action-germany) said based on a so-called heat stress index developed analysing satellite imagery.
Thirty-one cities received a "red card" when the NGO used the index to analyse the percentage of the population exposed to high-heat areas. Most cities (131) received a "yellow card", and 28 a "green card". In [its previous "heat check"](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/many-german-cities-badly-prepared-rising-temperatures-report), 24 cities had received a "red card".
Cities in southern Germany scored especially badly, with between 88 and 91 percent of residents affected by extreme heat in Mannheim, Ludwigshafen and Worms, [DUH](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/duh-environmental-action-germany) said. "From now on, greening cities and preserving trees must be given the same priority as housing construction and any other infrastructural development," said [DUH](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/duh-environmental-action-germany) head Barbara Metz. [DUH](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/duh-environmental-action-germany) called for cities and municipalities to urgently invest in green spaces, and for the government to set minimum green space requirements and support municipalities financially.
Around 3,000 people have died due to high temperatures in each of the past two summers in Germany, with people in urban areas at higher risk than those living in the countryside, [according](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/heat-kills-3000-people-every-summer-germany) to the Federal Environment Agency ([UBA](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/uba-federal-environment-agency)). Many cities and municipalities in Germany [have developed](https://difu.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/2025-06-11/praxistipps-fuer-den-umgang-mit-hitze-in-kommunen) [heat action plans](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/bayern/hitzeschutz-bayern-staedte-massnahmen-sommerhitze-klima-li.3268014) with short-term strategies and long-term structural measures to reduce health risks posed by heatwaves, hot days and tropical nights.

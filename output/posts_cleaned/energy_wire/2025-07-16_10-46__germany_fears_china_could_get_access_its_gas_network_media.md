# Germany fears that China could get access to its gas network – media
## 
Handelsblatt
Germany's economy and energy ministry is examining whether China could gain access to the German gas network via an Italian energy company, business daily Handelsblatt [reported](https://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/deutschland/energie-ministerium-fuerchtet-zugriff-chinas-auf-deutsches-gasnetz/100139833.html). The ministry is reviewing a deal by Italian gas network operator Snam to acquire a stake in Germany's largest gas network operator, Open Grid Europe ([OGE](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/open-grid-europe)), to determine whether it could pose "a threat to public order or security," the outlet reported.
In April, Snam announced its intention to acquire a 24.99 percent stake in [OGE](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/open-grid-europe) in a 920 million euro deal, from an investment company based in Abu Dhabi. However, the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) holds a significant stake in a holding company that is a minority shareholder at Snam, Handelsblatt reported.
Officials at the economy ministry have therefore initiated an in-depth investment review process, classifying the Chinese attempt to indirectly buy into [OGE](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/open-grid-europe) as "very delicate", the outlet wrote. It added that it is unclear what influence China’s national grid operator could exert on the operational management of Snam, and consequently on [OGE](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/open-grid-europe).
Following Russia's weaponisation of energy trading as part of its war on Ukraine, energy supply security has become a key issue for Europe. Germany [has stepped up](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/germany-step-critical-infrastructure-protection-new-law) its efforts to protect critical infrastructure – including the energy sector – against sabotage. The European Commission has previously [expressed concerns](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/military-experts-warn-security-risks-through-planned-chinese-wind-turbines-german-coast) about security and a growing dependence on China, including for energy transition technologies such as batteries and [offshore wind](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_o#offshore_wind) turbines.

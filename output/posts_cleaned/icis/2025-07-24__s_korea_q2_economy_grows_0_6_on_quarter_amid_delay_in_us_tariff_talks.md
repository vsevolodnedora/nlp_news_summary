SINGAPORE (ICIS)–South Korea’s economy grew by 0.5% year on year in the second quarter, avoiding a technical recession, the central bank’s data showed on Thursday. 
  * Exports, imports grow as South Korea’s economy recovers slightly 
  * Race to negotiate lower tariffs hit snag with cancelled US talks 
  * GDP growth forecast could be 0.7% if tariffs remain – AMRO 


On a seasonally adjusted quarter-on-quarter basis, GDP rose by 0.6% between April-June 2025, the Bank of Korea (BOK) said in a statement. 
Exports improved by 4.2% year on year on increased semiconductors, petroleum products and chemical product shipments, while imports were up 3.8% on an increase in energy items, such as crude oil and natural gas. 
South Korea is a major importer of raw materials like crude oil and naphtha, which it uses to produce a variety of petrochemicals, which are then exported. The country is a major exporter of aromatics such as benzene, toluene and styrene. 
Private consumption, accounting for roughly half of the country’s GDP, increased by 0.5% year over year in the second quarter. 
Manufacturing expanded by 2.7% year on year in the second quarter, up from the 0.4% growth in the first three months of 2025. 
**PRESSURE TO MEET TARIFF DEADLINE MOUNTS**  
South Korea faces a race to negotiate lower tariffs on the country imposed by the US, currently set at 25% and will take effect on 1 August if a deal is not reached. 
However, scheduled talks between the two countries on 25 July were cancelled as US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had a scheduling conflict, according to South Korea’s Finance Ministry on Thursday. 
The meeting will be rescheduled, the ministry added. 
Depending on the trade talk outcome, South Korea’s economy might grow by just 0.7% this year, according to Singapore-based ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) in an outlook on 23 July. 
Another key focus for South Korea is reducing automotive tariffs, with auto majors such as Hyundai and Kia dependent on exports to the US. 
A precedent has been set via a [ US-Japan trade deal](https://subscriber.icis.com/search/news/petchem/news-article-00111121572), which reduces Japanese automotive export tariffs to the US to 15% from 25% previously. 
**TRADE MINISTER EYES PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY REFORMS**  
Plans to revitalize the petrochemical industry have also stalled amid political instability wrought by former President Yoon Suk Yeol’s declaration of martial law back in December. 
New Minister of Trade, Industry and Energy, Kim Jung-kwan, who took office in June, has [ expressed his willingness](https://biz.chosun.com/en/en-industry/2025/07/21/ZT36UQ3UPRCXZKMNSYMQDOEFEE/) to restructure South Korea’s petrochemical industry, starting with the consolidation of naphtha cracking centers (NCC), located in the cities of Ulsan, Yeosu and Daesan. 
The NCC is a facility that produces general-purpose products such as ethylene, propylene and benzene, which are building blocks for the petrochemical industry. 
Laws preventing monopolies under the Fair Trade Act are a current stumbling block for such consolidation plans, and an exemption from the clause will have to be sought for plans to proceed. 
The hope is that a new government and greater political stability will pave the way for the restructuring of the struggling sector, even in the face of US tariffs threatening to slow the global economy down.

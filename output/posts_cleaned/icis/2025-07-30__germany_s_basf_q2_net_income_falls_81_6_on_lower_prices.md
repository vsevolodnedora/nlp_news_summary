SINGAPORE (ICIS)–BASF’s net income fell by 81.6% year on year in the second quarter, weighed by lower margins across Chemicals, Industrial Solutions and Materials segments, the German chemicals major said on Wednesday. 
**in € million** |  **Q2 2025** |  **Q2 2024** |  **% Change** |  **H1 2025** |  **H1 2024** |  **% Change**  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Sales  |  15,769  |  16,111  |  -2.1  |  33,171  |  33,664  |  -1.5   
Income from operations before depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)  |  1,475  |  1,563  |  -5.6  |  3,653  |  4,218  |  -13.4   
Income from operations (EBIT)  |  494  |  516  |  -4.3  |  1,690  |  2,205  |  -23.4   
Net income  |  79  |  430  |  -81.6  |  887  |  1,797  |  -50.6   
Negative currency effects and lower prices also contributed to the fall in sales. 
The Agricultural Solutions, Surface Technologies and Nutrition & Care segments achieved earnings growth, contrasting with “considerable earnings decline” in the Chemicals, Industrial Solutions and Materials segments.

Meanwhile, the Q2 EBITDA margin before special items was 11.2%, down from 12.1% in the prior-year quarter. 
Sales in the Chemicals segment declined in the first half of 2025, driven by global overcapacity and declining volumes which “positive portfolio effect” could not offset. 
The decline in the Petrochemicals division was mainly driven by lower margins for cracker products and in the propylene value chain, and in the Intermediates division, by lower volumes and prices, BASF said. 
**OUTLOOK**  
Growth is expected to weaken across all major regions in the second half of 2025 amid ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties, said BASF. 
It projects an average euro/dollar exchange rate in 2025 of $1.15/euro from $1.05/euro previously in the BASF full-year 2024 report, while the average annual oil price of Brent crude was forecast down to $70/barrel from $75/barrel previously. 
The company expects EBITDA before special items of between €7.3 billion and €7.7 billion for the full year of 2025, adjusted down from €8.0 billion to €8.4 billion forecast in the BASF full-year 2024 report. 
While the direct impact of US tariffs on the company remains limited, there are indirect effects on demand for products as well as prices, given “intensified competitive pressure and rising inflation”, said BASF. 
“It is still not possible to fully assess the resulting effects,” BASF added.

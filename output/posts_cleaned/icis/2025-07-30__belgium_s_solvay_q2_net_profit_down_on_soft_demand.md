SINGAPORE (ICIS)–Solvay’s underlying net profit from continuing operations fell by 15% year on year to €99 million in the second quarter (Q2) amid soft demand, the Belgian chemicals firm said on Wednesday. 
**in € million** |  **Q2 2025** |  **Q2 2024** |  **% Change** |  **H1 2025** |  **H1 2024** |  **% Change**  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Net sales  |  1,102  |  1,194  |  -7.8  |  2,223  |  2,396  |  -7.2   
EBITDA  |  230  |  272  |  -15.4  |  480  |  538  |  -10.8   
Net profit  |  99  |  116  |  -15.0  |  201  |  236  |  -14.8   
Solvay’s underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margin was down by 1.9 percentage points year on year to 20.9% from 22.8% in the second quarter. 
Basic Chemicals sales in Q2 2025 were down by 5.8% year on year compared with Q2 2024, the company said. 
Soda ash volumes, though improved sequentially compared to Q1, were lower year on year from sluggish demand in domestic markets and competition on the seaborne market. 
Bicarbonate demand continues to be robust, however. 
“The level of business activity in the first half of 2025 has been impacted by the uncertainty around the tariff discussions and heightened geopolitical tensions,” said Philippe Kehren, Solvay CEO. 
“Over the past few months, our industry has faced a soft market demand environment, and this is not expected to improve in the coming months.” 
As of 14 July, Solvay now expects underlying EBITDA for 2025 to be between €880 million and €930 million, revised down from €1.0 billion and €1.1 billion, assuming current foreign exchange levels for the second half of the year.

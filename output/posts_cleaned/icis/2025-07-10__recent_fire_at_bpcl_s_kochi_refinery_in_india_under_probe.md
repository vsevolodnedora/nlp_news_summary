MUMBAI (ICIS)–India’s state-owned Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) is currently assessing the impact of an 8 July fire incident at its Kochi refinery and petrochemical complex in the southern Kerala state, a company source said on Thursday. 
Twenty-three people were hospitalized – seven BPCL workers and 16 residents of the surrounding area – after inhaling smoke following an explosion and fire near BPCL’s central warehousing unit on 8 July, the source said. 
The fire was caused by a power fluctuation in a 200-kilovolt (kV) underground cable, which passes through a concealed trench on the BPCL Kochi Refinery campus, the company source said. 
This has affected some plant operations at the site, he said, but did not provide further information. 
Any impact on operations at any of the plants in the refinery is unclear, based on checks with other company sources. 
BPCL operates a 15.5 million tonne/year refinery at its Kochi complex and produces liquefied petroleum gas, naphtha, benzene, toluene, hexane, propylene, sulphur, petcoke and hydrogen. 
The company also operates a specialty propylene derivatives petrochemical project at its Kochi refinery complex which has the capacity to produce 160,000 tonnes/year of acrylic acid; 212,000 tonnes/year oxo alcohols (n-butanol, iso butanol and 2-ethyl hexanol); and 190,000 tonnes/year of acrylates (butyl acrylate and 2-ethyl hexyl acrylate). 
The Kerala state government announced that a special committee was created to investigate the fire which will submit its report within three days. 
A separate committee has been formed to review BPCL’s disaster management action plan and to recommend any changes within a week. 
The committee that will review BPCL’s disaster management plan will include the deputy collector of the district, BPCL’s security officer, electrical inspector and officials from the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB).

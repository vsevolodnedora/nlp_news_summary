  * EU energy commissioner confirms legal basis for Russia phaseout untested 
  * Commmission legal services confident force majeure would apply 
  * MEPs to next meet on topic in October 


LONDON (ICIS)—The EU’s energy chief acknowledged on 15 July that the European Commission could not guarantee the legal basis underpinning the bloc’s proposal to end Russian gas imports by 2028 and the plan was subject to challenges. 
“In a potential court case, it will be the individual contract that will be held up against the measures – this goes without saying,” EU energy commissioner Dan Jorgensen told MEPs. 
“So therefore there’s no 100% guarantee ever, it depends what’s on the paper,” he said. 
However, Jorgensen said the but said he was confident that proposal’s wording prohibiting imports of Russian pipeline gas and LNG meant force majeure applied and would negate any risk. 
Lawmakers in a joint session of the European Parliament’s trade and energy committees pressed Jorgensen repeatedly on whether the proposals were legally sound and how to strengthen this. 
While the lead MEPs for both committees urged the Commission to be more ambitious by phasing out Russia supply sooner and removing emergency clauses which would allow supply to resume, Jorgensen said countries’ concerns were valid. 
While he disagreed politically with Hungary and Slovakia’s criticisms, he said he hoped the inclusion of the emergency measures would calm those concerns. 
“The populations of those countries … have a legitimate right to know that whatever we do will not interfere with the prices or security of supply,” Jorgensen said, citing his experience working on emergency plans as Denmark’s energy minister after Russia cut supply to Europe in 2022. 
While there is broad support for the legislation in the Parliament, Jorgensen noted some national governments may prefer a more cautious approach. 
While two countries were vocally opposed to the plan, Jorgensen said “to be quite honest” that other countries also had found aspects of the plan worrying and this sentiment likely remained. 
While this was fair, he said he was confident the proposal would guarantee security of supply, amid declining gas consumption, rising LNG supply and development of domestic supplies and biomethane. 
Jorgensen’s home country of Denmark holds the rotating presidency of member states until the end of December and aims to finalise the legislation by then. 
The process will not require unanimity, unlike sanctions, but a speedy resolution may be challenging with Hungary and Slovakia opposed. 
Slovak prime minister Robert Fico said in a press release on 15 July that the Commission should allow his country a derogation, allowing it to fulfil its contract with Russia’s Gazprom until it ends in 2034. 
He said Slovakian diplomats were [instructed to delay](https://www.vlada.gov.sk/tlacove-spravy/vyjadrenie-predsedu-vlady-sr-roberta-fica-v-suvislosti-s-listom-od-predsednicky-europskej-komisie/) a vote on the EU’s 18th sanctions package against Russia in response, which include targeting transactions with the Nord Stream pipelines, Russian oil revenues and the shadow fleet. 
EU delegations were also scheduled to discuss the proposal at technical level on 15 July. 
MEPs will next meet about the proposals in October.

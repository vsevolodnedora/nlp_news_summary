HOUSTON (ICIS)–A federal appeals court has vacated the reciprocal switching [rule](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00110922826) enacted by the Surface Transportation Board (STB) last year, saying the agency exceeded its authority. 
Reciprocal switching is when a railroad that has physical access to a specific shipper facility switches rail traffic to the facility for another railroad that does not have physical access. 
The second railroad pays compensation to the railroad that has physical access, typically in the form of a per car switching charge. 
As a result of the arrangement, the shipper facility gains access to an additional railroad. 
The STB said its rule was a remedy for poor service. 
After the STB approved the rule, three major railroads – Union Pacific (UP), CSX and CN – filed a challenge in the court, saying the rule was unlawful. 
The US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit said in its [decision](https://www.trains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/7th-Circuit-EP711-Decision.pdf) this week that the performance standards in the rule were arbitrary, capricious and unsupported by the record. 
The court granted the petition to vacate the rule and sent it back to STB for further action. 
The chemical industry has generally been in favor of reciprocal switching and submitted statements in favor of the rule. 
Jeff Sloan, senior director of regulatory and scientific affairs at the American Chemistry Council (ACC), said the ACC was disappointed with the court’s ruling, but not overwhelmed. 
“When the rule was adopted, we felt it was too limited and would have limited benefits for chemical shippers,” he said. “But it is still disappointing that – even if you know this very limited attempt to increase access to competitive rail service – has been denied by the court.” 
Sloan said the STB has authority to use reciprocal switching in two ways – when it is in the public interest, and when it is necessary to promote competition. 
“We felt the better approach was for the board to use the tools that Congress gave it to promote competition more broadly,” Sloan said, “and I think this decision confirms that.” 
The rule was passed under the previous presidential administration, and Sloan said he sees nothing that would indicate the current administration is likely to oppose the rule if it was based on promoting competition. 
“The administration has issued a number of executive orders on regulations, and they have asked the agencies to focus on regulations that are anticompetitive,” Sloan said. 
Sloan said it is still too early to predict the path forward. 
“We would strongly urge the board to look at the options it has to use its statutory authority to promote competition,” Sloan said. 
The chemical industry is one of the largest users of the freight rail system, and it relies on efficient, reliable, competitive railroads to meet its transportation needs. 
“When it falls short, it is harmful to US chemical producers,” Sloan said. 
Eric Byer, president and CEO of the Alliance for Chemical Distribution (ACD), said he respects the court’s decision while urging the STB to work toward providing shippers with a meaningful reciprocal switching remedy. 
“The STB’s original goal, to address inadequate rail service and provide more competitive access, is both necessary and long overdue,” Byer said. “In recent years, widespread rail service challenges have exposed critical vulnerabilities in the freight system, and the chemical distribution industry continues to face the consequences of limited-service options and poor reliability.” 
Railroads are vital to the chemicals industry as chemical railcar loadings represent about 20% of chemical transportation by tonnage in the US, with trucks, barges and pipelines carrying the rest. 
Canada-based chemical producers rely on rail to ship more than 70% of their products, with some exclusively using rail. 
About 80% of Canada’s chemical production goes into export, with about 80% of those exports going to the US.

BARCELONA (ICIS)–Slowing demand growth and a battle for market share between Saudi Arabia and the US could see crude oil prices drop significantly by the end of the year. 
  * High oil prices stimulate more production, low prices less 
  * Saudi Arabia and the US battle for market share 
  * Global demand for oil is around 100 million barrels/day 
  * Electric vehicles (EVs) have destroyed 2 million barrels/day of oil demand 
  * Around 20% of global vehicle sales are EVs 
  * Oil prices could fall to $40-$45/barrel by the end of the year 
  * Oil demand growth weakest in 16 years 
  * Low oil price is double-edged sword for chemical markets

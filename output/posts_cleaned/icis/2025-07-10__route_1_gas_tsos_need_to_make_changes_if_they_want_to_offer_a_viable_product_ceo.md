  * Route 1 capacity should be offered on quarterly basis 
  * Capacity will be used only as last-resort if TSOs do not slash tariffs further 
  * Ukraine renewable sector needs support mechanism 


ROME (ICIS)–Traders looking to export gas from Greece to Ukraine using a new bundled capacity product would benefit from three key improvements by grid operators, the CEO of D.Trading, the company that is currently using this route, told ICIS. 
Dmytro Sakharuk said transmission system operators should consider increasing the capacity allocated for this route, which uses the Trans-Balkan corridor, extend the booking period and reduce tariffs. 
Speaking on the sidelines of the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome on 9 July, the CEO said his company booked the largest capacity for gas exports from the Greek VTP to Ukrainian storage in July. 
He said gas transmission system operators (TSOs) need to allocate a minimum firm capacity to allow companies to predict their market position. 
Currently, Route 1 capacity is [offered](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/energy/news-article-00111102654) based on what is left over after firm capacity for standard products is booked during regular monthly auctions. 
However, Sakharuk said gas grid operators should guarantee at least a minimum capacity which traders can count on every month. 
He also noted that if the product, currently offered on a temporary basis, were to be extended beyond October, it should be marketed for a longer period. 
Sakharuk said traders would benefit if this capacity were offered on a quarterly basis as many companies may be looking to import LNG via Greece, which may require greater time flexibility in terms of imports, regasification and send-out. 
TARIFFS 
Most importantly, however, Sakharuk said transmission system operators need to reduce transmission costs even more than they currently do. 
Grid operators agreed to reduce by 25% aggregated transmission tariffs from Greece up to the Romania-Ukraine border, with a further reduction of 47% expected between the Ukrainian and Moldovan borders. 
Nevertheless, Sakharuk said, even when accounting for the discounts, the fixed capacity cost was €6.68/MWh which, he said, was excessively high. 
This cost does not include additional variables, which bring the total transmission cost up to €9.00/MWh. 
Sakharuk said gas grid operators should benchmark these costs against much cheaper routes from Hungary or Poland. 
The cost to ship gas along Route 1 is disproportionately higher because Romania’s Transgaz and its Moldovan subsidiary, VMTG, charge some of the heftiest transmission costs in the region despite having no compression costs along the route. 
Sakharuk said that, unless grid operators implemented these changes, the route will never be viable and traders will only use it as a last resort if all regional transmission capacity elsewhere is fully booked. 
RENEWABLES 
On a different note, speaking at one of the side events organised by the Florence School of Regulation and Ukraine-based think tank Dixi Group, Sakharuk also referred to the development of the renewable sector in Ukraine. 
He said the country needed to introduce a support scheme if it was serious about scaling up clean production. 
He said his company, a subsidiary of DTEK, Ukraine’s largest private power and gas producer, sees a lot of investor interest in developing the wind and solar sector despite war-related risks. 
However, he said many developers were put off by falling electricity prices which meant it was difficult to take a long-term investment decision if prices were forecast to fall. 
The price decline is largely the effect of a vicious cycle, also affecting EU producers, where rising renewable output was depressing margins. 
However, while EU countries benefit from generous funds in supporting scaled up projects, Ukraine does not have similar schemes, which means that investors are reluctant to commit to long-term projects.

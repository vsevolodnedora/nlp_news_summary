SINGAPORE (ICIS)–Click [here](https://www.icis.com/asian-chemical-connections/2025/07/chaos-confusion-chemicals-and-no-more-comfortable-carpet-slippers/) to see the latest blog post on Asian Chemical Connections by John Richardson: From 1992 until 2021, predicting chemicals and polymers markets was simple. Booming China, youthful consumer demand, and stable globalization made assumptions as comfortable as an old pair of carpet slippers. Climate change risks felt distant, and plastic waste implications were largely overlooked. 
Not anymore. The slippers have fallen apart. We’re now navigating wildly difficult market conditions, like walking barefoot on a pebble beach – sharp pains could hit at any moment. 
Some analysts are waiting for a return to the “Old Normal.” But as the saying goes, “Those who can’t count the things that count, count the things that don’t count.” Markets are much more complex now; we must acknowledge this to move forward. 
The good news? AI offers a lifeline. It can help us measure complex patterns humans can’t, from the impact of climate migration on demand to how geopolitical shifts reshape trade. It can also optimize plastic waste recycling and effectively monitor carbon emissions for fair taxation/credits. 
This new era demands multi-layered scenario planning. For example, you should combine my Iran-Israel crisis scenarios, from my 1 July post, with three global economic scenarios (produced with the help of ChatGPT Plus) stemming from US President Donald Trump’s recent tariff announcements. 
Here’s a snapshot of what could happen: 
  * Best-Case: Tariffs soften, markets stabilize, and global GDP takes only a mild hit. 
  * Medium-Case: Tariffs escalate, retaliation begins. Supply chains stress, stagflation fears return, and major economies flirt with recession. 
  * Worst-Case: All-in trade war, depression risk. Global GDP contracts sharply, trade collapses, and unemployment surges worldwide. 


Confused? You should be! The only sensible response is to embrace complex and nuanced scenario planning to protect your business.

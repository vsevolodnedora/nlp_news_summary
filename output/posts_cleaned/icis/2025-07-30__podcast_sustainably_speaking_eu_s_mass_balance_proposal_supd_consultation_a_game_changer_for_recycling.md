LONDON (ICIS)–Join **John Richardson** , ICIS senior executive, business solutions group, in Episode 4 of Sustainably Speaking along with **Mark Victory** and**Matt Tudball** , senior editors for recycling Europe, and **Helen McGeough** , global analyst team lead for plastic recycling as they discuss the [European Commission’s proposals](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13467-Single-use-plastic-beverage-bottles-EU-rules-for-calculating-verifying-and-reporting-on-recycled-plastic-content_en) to allow [mass balance for chemical recycling](https://subscriber.icis.com/search/news/petchem/news-article-00111117960) using a fuel-exempt accounting approach under the Single Use Plastics Directive (SUPD), and what this means for the wider recycling world. 
Plus, how [amendments in the draft Implementing Decision](https://subscriber.icis.com/search/news/petchem/news-article-00111119429) allow for recyclate from outside the EU to count towards the 25% recycled content for polyethylene terephthlate (PET) beverage bottles, as well as what is going on in the wider world of recycling. 
Some questions answered during this episode: 
  * Why is this draft Implementing Decision on mass balance so important, and what does ‘fuel-exempt’ mean? 
  * Will this increase investment in chemical recycling in Europe and what happens if other regions go for a ‘free allocation’ approach? 
  * What’s the impact on global operators working in different markets? 
  * Can recyclate made from post-consumer plastic waste placed on third country markets count towards recycled content targets? 
  * What does a ‘level playing field’ for Europe look like? 
  * Will there be a sudden acceleration of chemical recycling projects as Europe’s crackers close? 
  * Is chemical recycling the solution for mass-scale food contact for polyolefins in Europe by 2030?

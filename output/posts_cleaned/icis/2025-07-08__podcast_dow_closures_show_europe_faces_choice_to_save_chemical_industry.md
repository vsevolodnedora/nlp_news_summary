LONDON (ICIS)–European politicians must decide if they want to save the region’s chemical industry as the wave of energy-intensive closures continues. 
  * Dow to close cracker at Bohlen, Germany, plus two other sites with loss of 800 jobs 
  * More than 5 million tonnes/year of ethylene capacity now under threat in Europe 
  * Industry still faces high energy costs, regulatory burdens, unfair competition 
  * China will continue to add capacity at least to 2030 
  * China chemical plants running at higher-than-expected operating rates 
  * Importing ethylene and propylene can be expensive 
  * Political support will be vital to save Europe’s chemical industry 
  * New US tariffs may see two-tier chemical markets emerge in Asia 
  * Uncertainty and chaos likely to persist

LONDON (ICIS)–Chemicals production in German contracted 3% in the first half of 2025 offsetting an expansion in pharmaceuticals output to drive the industry as a whole to a 1% contraction, trade body VCI said on Thursday. 
Industry productivity remains 15% below the pre-crisis levels seen in 2018, with no sign of a turnaround this year, according to VCI president and Covestro chief Markus Steilemann. 
“We are also seeing double-digit declines in other important sectors of the economy,” he said. 
Covestro, along with other Germany-based peers BASF and FUCHS Group, downgraded full-year earnings expectations for 2025 in the last week on prolonged weak demand and the depressed macroeconomic environment. 
Uncertainty remains a key headwind for the sector, with 40% of VCI member companies lamenting the disorganised global trade environment, as industry balances continue to weaken. 
Chemicals exports weakened year on year during the period, while imports increased 2%, VCI said. 
Total sector sales dropped 0.5% year on year during the period as prices stagnated, and capacity utilisation stood below 80% into a third consecutive year, below the profitability threshold for many products. 
The decline in productivity was more pronounced for the polymer and basic chemicals sectors, where production fell 3.5%, while petrochemicals and derivatives output fell 2.5%. 
Fine and specialty chemicals production fell 3% in the first half of the year, while detergents and personal care products output dropped 1% over the same period. 
“In the medium term, there is no improvement in sight. Germany is struggling with the third recession in a row,” VCI said. “Neither the economic institutes nor the majority of VCI member companies expect an economic upturn in the second half of 2025.” 
Moves by Germany’s new federal government to increase public investment and reduce bureaucratic roadblocks is a welcome one, according to Steilemann, who called for further cuts to red tape and an easing of the country’s debt brake, a focus on affordability in energy policy. Diversifying trade and stronger integration of the EU as a market.

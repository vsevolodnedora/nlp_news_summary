SINGAPORE (ICIS)–Royal Vopak has signed an agreement with Japanese heavy-industry firm IHI Corp to establish a joint venture for the development and operation of an ammonia terminal in Japan, the Dutch provider of storage and infrastructure solutions firm said on Friday. 
The terminal is expected to start operations in the Japanese fiscal year 2030, it said in a statement. 
“The ammonia terminal development aims to facilitate the receiving and storing of imported ammonia within Japan and to facilitate the establishment of a system for stable supply of such ammonia in Japan,” Vopak said. 
Ammonia is expected to contribute to Japan’s decarbonization goals through its increased use as fuel and raw material in power generation and various industrial uses, it said. 
The collaboration focuses on developing a broader ammonia supply chain in Japan, with the goal of promoting the various uses of ammonia. 
IHI and Vopak also aim to establish an efficient ammonia distribution system by utilizing an ammonia terminal with a hub function for marine transportation. 
Vopak, which currently operates six ammonia storage facilities globally, had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Japan’s IHI in November 2023 to jointly investigate developing and operating efficient, high value-added ammonia terminals in Japan.

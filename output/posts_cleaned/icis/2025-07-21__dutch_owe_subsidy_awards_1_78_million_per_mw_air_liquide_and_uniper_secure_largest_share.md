LONDON (ICIS)–On 21 July a spokesperson for the Dutch Ministry of Climate and Green Growth told ICIS that €1.78 million per megawatt (MW) of electrolysis capacity is the average grant amount for the 11 renewable hydrogen projects in the latest round of the government’s development of the hydrogen economy scheme (OWE). 
OWE awarded a total of over [ €700 million](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00111120633) in subsidies for a combined 602MW of electrolyser capacity. 
OWE provides up to 80% of the capital costs for building a hydrogen production plant and covers the difference between the cost of generating renewable hydrogen and the cost of generating carbon-intensive hydrogen through steam methane reforming. 
The ministry also revealed the MW per project, with energy companies Air Liquide and Uniper securing the largest share of subsidised capacity, with 192MW and 178MW respectively. This makes up over 60% of the total. 
A spokesperson for Uniper has confirmed to ICIS that the subsidy has been awarded for the company’s 500MW Maasvlakte project, for which it targets operations by 2030. The company has not disclosed the amount awarded. 
ICIS has reached out to Air Liquide for the details of its awarded project in Rotterdam. In February the company announced it will build a [ 200MW plant](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00111075862) there, which is expected to be operational by 2027. 
It has an estimated production of up 23,000 tons of renewable and low-carbon hydrogen annually and will supply energy major TotalEnergies through a long-term contract. 
In 2024 the company began construction of the Porthos carbon capture and storage project in the port of Rotterdam, which is expected to be completed in 2026 and aims to enable the production low-carbon hydrogen.

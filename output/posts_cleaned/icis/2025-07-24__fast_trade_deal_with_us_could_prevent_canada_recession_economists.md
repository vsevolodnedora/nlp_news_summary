TORONTO (ICIS)–Canada is heading into a “trade war-induced recession” – unless it can reach a quick deal with the US, with low tariffs and a “significant de-escalation”, economists at Oxford Economics said in a webinar. 
  * 1 August deal could avoid recession 
  * US tariffs hit Canadian exports, investments, housing, jobs 
  * USMCA compliance to provide relief 
  * Increased defense spending offers limited domestic stimulus 


Canada’s government is [targeting a deal by 1 August](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00111118596) but does not provide updates on the trade talks and does not disclose what concessions it may make, insisting it will not negotiate in public. 
If there is a quick deal, it would result in improved prospects for Canadian GDP growth, said Tony Stillo, director for Canada, and economist Michael Davenport. 
However, if a deal is not reached by 1 August, Canada could face the 35% tariffs US President Trump [threatened](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00111118454) for all Canadian exports that are not compliant with the rules of origin and other conditions of the existing US-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement, the economists said. 
The 35% tariffs, coming on top of the US sectoral tariffs on autos, aluminum, steel, pharmaceuticals and potentially also copper, would imply a deeper and longer downturn of Canada’s economy, they said. 
As it stands, the global forecasting firm believes that Canada likely already slipped into a recession that could last through the end of 2025. 
It is currently forecasting a 0.8% peak-to-trough decline in GDP from Q2 to Q4 2025. 
  * Oxford’s baseline forecast for Canada’s GDP is for 0.9% growth in 2025, slowing to 0.4% in 2026 but rebounding 3.0% in 2027. 
  * Industrial production, widely seen as a proxy for chemical and plastics demand, is expected to decline by 0.5% in 2025 and 2.1% in 2026 before rising by 3.3% in 2027, according to its estimates. 


**EXPORTS DROP**  
Lower exports are the primary negative factor hitting Canadian GDP, but the tariff uncertainties also affect investment plans, households, housing and employment, the Oxford economists said. 
The US is by far the most important market for Canadian exports, including chemicals and plastics. 
In chemicals, 77% of Canada’s exports of industrial chemicals headed to the US last year, according to trade group Chemistry Industry Association of Canada (CIAC). 
While Canadian exports to the US rose early this year during a period of “front-loading” when companies tried to get ahead of the tariffs, they have started to decline noticeably more recently. 
In May, [Canadian goods exports](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00111116764) to the US were off 27% from a peak in January, and down 16% year on year, the Oxford economists said. 
The US share of total Canadian goods exports has fallen to about 68%, from a 75% average in 2024, they said. 
In addition to the direct impact of declining exports, the tariff uncertainties have also affected firms and households. 
Companies’ investment plans, in particular for machinery and equipment, have largely stalled and expectations for future employment have declined, the economists said. 
“Persistent under-investment has been a challenge for the Canadian economy for the last decade or so, and that will be exacerbated by the trade war,” noted Davenport. 
Oxford expects the US tariffs to lead to about 140,000 job losses in Canada by the end of this year, especially in manufacturing, which is mostly concentrated in Ontario and Quebec. 
The unemployment rate is expected to rise to 7.6%, Davenport said. The rate was at [6.9% in June](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00111118632). 
In housing, which is an important end market for chemicals and plastics, re-sales have slumped, and unless there is an immediate trade deal with the US, the slump will accelerate in the second half of this year and extend into 2026, Davenport pointed out. 
While housing starts have been holding up so far, they are expected to slow in the second half of the year, partly due to rising building costs on the back of tariffs, as well as high interest rates, he said. 
**INTEREST RATES**  
With the “stagflationary tariff shock” Canada’s central bank, the Bank of Canada (BoC), would need to balance concerns over higher prices with a downturn in the economy, the Oxford economists said. 
Oxford expects Canada’s consumer price inflation to rise to 3.0% by the middle of 2026, from [1.9% in June](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00111119458). 
Inflation has been relatively mild in recent months, but this was largely due to the removal of the federal consumer carbon tax in April, the economists noted. 
Uncertainty about tariffs and their impact led the BoC to keep the policy rate at 2.75% in June and Oxford expects it will stay there. The BoC’s next rate decision is expected to be announced on 30 July. 
**DEFENSE SPENDING**  
Canada’s commitment to raise defense spending to 2% of GDP this fiscal year will not prevent a recession, the economists said. 
The defense spending hike would go largely on salaries, with “a little bit” going to equipment, Stillo said. 
Longer-term, Canada has committed to spend 5% of GDP on defense by 2035. 
However, much of the defense equipment would likely continue to be imported from the US, Stillo noted. Imports are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP. 
Also, the higher defense spending will likely be debt-financed, thus raising the government debt-to-GDP ratio and leading to higher long-term bond yields, which flow through to mortgage rates, thus squeezing housing affordability, he said. 
Prime Minister Mark Carney said he is aiming for a comprehensive trade and security deal with the US, but did not say if he will use Canadian spending on US military equipment as a bargaining chip in the trade talks. 
**TARIFF RATES, USMCA COMPLIANCE, RETALIATION**  
Oxford currently estimates that the effective average tariff rate Canada faces on all goods exported to the US is 14.1%. 
However, with a 35% tariff on non-USMCA-compliant goods, the effective rate would rise to an estimated 18.3% on 1 August, if no deal is reached by then, according to Oxford. 
The following chart shows Oxford Economics’ estimates since March for effective rates of US and Canadian tariffs.

It remains unclear what retaliatory measures Canada will take if no deal is reached by 1 August and the US 35% tariff on non-USMCA-compliant goods comes into effect. 
The economists said Canada, along with Mexico, are highly reliant on trade with the US, but both are less affected than other countries by the trade tensions because of the [exemption for USMCA-compliant imports](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00111118623). 
USMCA compliance of Canadian goods exports has increased in recent months and was at 56% as of May, up from 38% in 2024, according to Oxford’s estimates. 
For plastics products and autos and parts the compliance rates are especially high, as the following chart by Oxford Economics shows: 
![](https://www.icis.com/explore/resources/news/2025/07/24/11121937/fast-trade-deal-with-us-could-prevent-canada-recession-economists/)
Most of the increase in compliance was in Canadian fuels exports, which are subject to a lower tariff of 10%. 
Meanwhile, temporary government relief from Canada’s retaliatory tariffs should help Canadian companies. 
About C$96 billion (US$71 billion) of goods imported from the US face Canadian retaliatory tariffs, but the government has granted tariff relief (remissions) for goods imports worth between C$56-64 billion, the economists said. 
The tariff relief is for a wide range of imported products in manufacturing, processing, food and beverage packaging, healthcare, public health and safety, national security, and cases “with severe adverse impacts” and a lack of non-US suppliers, Stillo said. 
Which products qualify for relief “is still subject to interpretation”, Stillo pointed out before adding, “There is a lot there that firms could use to get tariff relief.” 
Stillo said although the retaliatory tariffs were a tax on Canadians, the government had to act against the US tariffs, saying, “You can’t just cave in to President Trump.” 
Canada’s retaliatory tariffs try to target US goods that can be substituted and where the counter-tariffs affect the US economy more than the Canadian economy, he said. 
On the other hand, the government is providing tariff relief for imported intermediate goods that are deeply integrated into the North American manufacturing process, he said. 
“So, they are trying to give companies an opportunity to find alternative suppliers, suppliers that are not US-based, not an easy thing to do,” he added. 
Oxford Economics assumes that most US tariffs will be removed by Q3 2026 as the USMCA is renegotiated. However, targeted tariffs of 10% will remain in place for metal and select agricultural products. 
Likewise, Oxford expects Canada to remove most of its retaliatory measures by Q3 2026.

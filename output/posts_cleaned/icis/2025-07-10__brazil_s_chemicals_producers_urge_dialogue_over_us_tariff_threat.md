SAO PAULO (ICIS)–Brazil’s trade group representing chemicals producers Abiquim has expressed concern over US President Donald Trump’s [threat to impose 50% tariffs](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00111118167) on Brazilian exports, calling for technical dialogue to resolve the dispute. 
In a written response to ICIS, Abiquim said the issue holds major relevance for the chemical sector, not only due to direct exports to the US but also because the industry supplies key inputs to export sectors including food processing and pulp and paper. 
The Brazilian chemical sector runs a significant trade deficit with the US, importing approximately $10.4 billion, while exporting just $2.4 billion in 2024, said Abiquim. 
The resulting trade deficit in favor of the US stood at $7.9 billion – by volume, the deficit totaled 6 million tonnes, said Abiquim. 
US petrochemicals subsectors such as caustic soda, polyethylene (PE), or acetic acid, among many others, [export in large numbers to Brazil](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00111118168) and could be greatly affected if Brazil retaliates to the tariffs in kind. 
“The chemical industry advocates treating international trade relations exclusively on the basis of mutual economic gain and the free market, following the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO). In a scenario subject to political interference, we believe that technical dialogue is the best way to resolve this issue,” said Abiquim. 
“Both sides are at risk of losses, as they are important markets for each other’s exports. Therefore, negotiations are necessary to avoid potential losses for all parties involved.”

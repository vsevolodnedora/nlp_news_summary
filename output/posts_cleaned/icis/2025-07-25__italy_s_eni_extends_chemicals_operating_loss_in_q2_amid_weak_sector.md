SINGAPORE (ICIS)–Eni’s chemical business reported a narrower proforma adjusted loss of €184 million in the second quarter of 2025, mainly attributed to reduced oil-based feedstock expenses, although the chemical sector remains weak, the Italy-headquartered producer said on Friday. 
This compared with a loss of €222 million during the same period last year. 
**Chemicals**
**€ million** |  **Q2 2025** |  **Q2 2024** |  **H1 2025** |  **H1 2024**  
---|---|---|---|---  
Proforma adjusted EBIT  |  – 184  |  – 222  |  -427  |  -390   
Eni’s chemicals business is managed by Versalis. 
Sales of chemical products decreased 5% year on year in the second quarter amid lower demand and plant shutdown. 
In the first six months of the year, chemical product sales fell 6% year on year. 
Plant utilization rates averaged 47% in the second quarter, an increase of two percentage points from the same period last year. 
Margins remained weak across the board as commodity prices were unable to offset feedstock and energy input expenses amid “European headwinds, sluggish economic activity and competitive pressures from players with better cost structures”, the company said.

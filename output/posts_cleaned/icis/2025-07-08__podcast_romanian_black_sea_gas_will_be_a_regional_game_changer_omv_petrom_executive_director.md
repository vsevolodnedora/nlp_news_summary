High capacity-booking interest for gas exports from Romania to Hungary for the next ten years indicate regional companies may be preparing for the start of Black Sea gas production from 2027. 
In 2024, Romania became the EU’s largest gas producer, a position that is likely to be further consolidated when the Neptun Deep block comes on stream. 
The project has faced political and regulatory headwinds over the years, and first volumes are set to reach markets at a time of numerous changes including surging global LNG production. 
In this podcast, Franck Neel, executive board member of project operator OMV Petrom, tells Aura Sabadus about latest developments at Neptun Deep, the company’s regional expansion plans and why Romanian Black Sea gas will have a competitive edge.

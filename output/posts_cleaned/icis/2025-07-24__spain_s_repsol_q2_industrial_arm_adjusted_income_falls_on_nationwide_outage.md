SINGAPORE (ICIS)–Repsol’s industrial segment posted a 65.6% year-on-year drop in its second quarter adjusted income amid weaker results in Refining and Chemical, which were negatively impacted by trade and a nationwide [ outage in Spain](https://subscriber.icis.com/search/news/petchem/news-article-00111096529) on 28 April. 
The losses were partially offset by higher results in Repsol Peru and Wholesale and Gas Trading, as well as lower taxes mainly due to lower operating income, the company said in a statement.

---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Adjusted Income  |  99  |  288  |  -65.6  |  230  |  1,019  |  -77.4   
Current cost of supplies (CCS) operating income  |  119  |  375  |  -68.3  |  294  |  1,325  |  -77.8

EBITDA CCS  |  329  |  568  |  -42.1  |  732  |  1,439  |  -49.1   
“In Chemicals, operating income was €33 million lower year-on-year mainly due to lower cogeneration results as well as lower volumes mainly impacted by the negative effects of the Spanish outage that happened on 28 April 2025,” Repsol said. 
These were partially redressed by higher margins, the company added. 
Repsol’s chemical margin indicator rose 22.3% year on year to €329/tonne in the second quarter. 
Meanwhile, petrochemical product sales fell by 7.4% year on year to 441,000 tonnes in the second quarter. 
The industrial segment consists of activities involving oil refining, petrochemicals and the trading, transport and sale of crude oil, natural gas and fuels, including the development of new growth platforms. 
Repsol’s group net income fell to €237 million in the second quarter from €657 million in the same period of last year, which was a 63.9% decline.

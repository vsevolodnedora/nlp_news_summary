European energy company MET Group said on Monday 7 July it had acquired 100% of gas storage operator KGE, based in Gronau, Germany. 
KGE operates a H-gas storage facility in Gronau-Epe capable of holding 179 million cubic metres of natural gas, injecting 150,000 Nm _3_ /h of gas and withdrawing 400,000 Nm _3_ /h at maximum capacity. 
This represents around 0.7% of Germany’s total combined gas storage capacity. 
The facility is connected to the German THE hub. 
According to MET CEO Benjamin Lakatos, the acquisition will “strengthen our position in the German market” while furthering natural gas infrastructure in Germany. 
According to ICIS price assessments on Friday 4 July, German gas for the coming winter season was assessed at €36.725/MWh, a rough €3.00/MWh premium to the Summer ’26. 
While not a significant premium in historical terms, the €3.00/MWh figure does show a widening of the seasonal spread in Germany in recent months. As recently as March for example, the Summer ’25 was priced marginally higher than the Winter ’26 largely due to uncertainty over summer injection demand. 
In Germany, MET Group has been active since 2020 operating two natural gas storage facilities at the Etzel and Reckrod sites. 
MET is present in 32 national gas markets and in 44 international trading hubs, trading 140 billion cubic meters of natural gas in 2024.

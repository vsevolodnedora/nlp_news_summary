LONDON (ICIS)–BASF and Covestro’s moves to manage expectations for full-year earnings growth underline the precarity of global economic growth, with potential for heavy US tariffs on the EU only serving to further weigh on sentiment. 
The two Germany-based companies announced downgrades to their full-year growth expectations on 11 July, with both attributing the move to macroeconomic weakness. 
BASF now expects 2025 global GDP growth of 2.0-2.5% compared to earlier expectations of 2.6%. 
This is likely to drive down the company’s full-year earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) pre-special items to €7.3-€7.7 billion from previous forecasts of €8-8.4 billion. 
In addressing the US’ shifting tariff plans, BASF executives have emphasised the global spread of the company’s operations, insulating the company from the direct impact of inter-regional trade barriers. 
Company CFO Dirk Elvermann estimated that 90% of its European revenues are derived from local production, as well as 90% in North America – 80% in the US – and 80% in Asia Pacific, a figure likely to rise once its Zhanjiang, China, Verbund site starts up. 
This local resilience cannot offset the overall demand hit from a global manufacturing sector that has been impacted in some places by new trade barriers, and spooked by the global economic turmoil in others. 
Market demand for chemical products would likely grow less than previously expected, the company said in the press statement released [last Friday](https://subscriber.icis.com/search/news/petchem/news-article-00111098284). Due to continued high product availability on the market, margins continued to remain under pressure, especially upstream, it added. 
BASF’s revised earnings forecast represents a cut of 8% at the mid-point from previous expectations, while Covestro [expects](https://subscriber.icis.com/search/news/petchem/news-article-00111118583) 2025 EBITDA to stand at €700 million – €1.1 billion, compared to previous guidance of €1-1.4 billion. 
Also attributing the downgrade to a weak economy with little hope of a short-term recovery. The announcement comes despite projected second-quarter earnings of €270 million, near the top of its earlier €200 million – €300 million guidance. 
The company also beat out consensus estimates for first-quarter EBITDA, despite levels halving from the same period a year earlier, hinting that more pain may be ahead in the second half of the year. 
**GLOBAL SLOWDOWN**  
BASF’s current GDP growth expectations are substantially below the 2.8% projected by the IMF in April, itself a 0.5 percentage point downgrade from forecasts the organisation issued in January. 
Projections are tougher than usual to make amid such a shifting global outlook, but the fact remains that each new global GDP forecast this year issued by almost any organisation is lower than the one that preceded it. 
So far, this has all taken place with few of the major new tariffs from the US coming into play, with the 2 April announcement of global levies paused through to July, and new numbers only beginning to emerge in the last week. 
**TARIFF FEARS REVIVE**  
So far, the US has proposed 50% tariffs on imports from Brazil and 20% tariffs on Vietnam and rates of 30% on China, along with potential plans for new rates for most goods from 21 other nations. This includes a new proposed tariff of 30% on EU goods, currently set to come into effect on 1 August. 
The expectation remains among investors that a deal will be struck between Washington and Brussels that will prevent that, with [stronger](https://subscriber.icis.com/search/news/petchem/news-article-00111119383) German business sentiment in July driven in large part by that hope. 
Nevertheless, the prospect of 30% tariffs is “effectively prohibitive of mutual trade” according to European Commission trade minister Maros Sefcovic, speaking on the side lines of a Commission meeting on Monday. 
Sefcovic also expressed dismay at the US announcement of fresh EU tariffs while the two blocs are in the midst of negotiations. 
The proposed first wave of EU tariffs on US goods, totalling €21 billion, remains paused through to August, and the Commission has shared plans for a larger package of measures on around €72 billion of US imports. 
The Commission is also pushing harder to rebalance trade away from the US, with a focus at present on talks with Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia and India. 
While the EU-US tariffs may be negotiated away or at least talked down from the current proposed levels – US President Donald Trump had previously proposed 50% rates on EU imports – the uncertainty around the many global talks is likely do dog economic growth well into the third quarter. 
Heightened investor caution and decision paralysis on bigger investments has been one of the dominant themes of 2025 so far in the wake of the tariff discussions, and this will continue to weigh on GDP and chemicals demand growth until the way ahead looks clearer. 
Despite moves in the sector, particularly in Europe, to push further up value chains towards more defensible positions in specialties, the chemicals sector remains tied to GDP growth rates. 
Players may be able to push growth a few points above global economic growth, but that capacity is limited, particularly when demand uncertainty is pushing buyers to maintain low inventories. 
There had been little hope for a strong recovery this year but at the current trajectory, global growth this year and next is likely to be lower even than 2024, making for even more of an uphill battle for players to push back to the middle of the cycle. 
BASF announces its full second-quarter results on 30 July, while Covestro is expected to release its financials for the period on 31 July.

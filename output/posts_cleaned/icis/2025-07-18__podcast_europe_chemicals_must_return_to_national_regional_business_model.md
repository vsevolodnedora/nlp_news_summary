BARCELONA (ICIS)–As the existing global trading system crumbles, and overcapacity keeps growing, Europe’s chemical industry must shift to a more national or regional business model. 
  * Trade war shows global trading system is breaking down 
  * Chemical industry should shift to a national or regional business model 
  * Would be a return to pre-1990s industry structure 
  * Europe has smaller chemical plants, ideal for regional markets 
  * EU must now act fast to protect chemical and industrial value chains 
  * China chemicals has been based on 6-8% GDP growth per year 
  * Now real GDP growth is only 1-4%, according to unofficial estimates

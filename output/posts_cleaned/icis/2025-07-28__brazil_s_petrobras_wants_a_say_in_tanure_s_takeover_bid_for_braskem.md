MADRID (ICIS)–Petrobras has appealed to Brazil’s antitrust regulator CADE to secure its participation in Nelson Tanure’s bid to control petrochemicals major Braskem, according to the Brazilian state-owned energy major. 
Petrobras – which controls 36.1% of Braskem capital structure – claims it has been excluded from negotiations even though it is one of the company’s largest shareholders. 
In May, Brazilian entrepreneur Nelson Tanure’s investment fund Petroquimica Verde [made an offer to acquire](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00111104112) Novonor’s 38.3% stake in Braskem. 
The Novonor stake is a controlling one as it has 51.1% of the voting rights. Petrobras has 47% of the voting rights. 
However, according to a Braskem shareholder agreement between Petrobras and Novonor, the energy major has pre-emptive and tag-along rights in the event of a direct or indirect sale of the shares held by Novonor. 
“Petrobras has requested to join as a third party in the merger review proceedings evaluating the possible purchase of shares in NSP Inv, a subsidiary of Novonor, which controls Braskem, by Nelson Tanure,” said Petrobras. 
The Petrobras appeal to CADE comes less than a week after the antitrust regulator [approved Tanure’s proposal](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00111120310) without restrictions. 
However, CADE said the deal can only proceed if Tanure fulfills the Novonor shareholders’ agreement obligations with Petrobras and succeeds in talks with former Odebrecht’s creditor banks, which hold Braskem shares as collateral for debts of around Brazilian reais (R) 15 billion ($2.7 billion). 
“For this reason, the company requested that the competition agency allow it to join the proceedings as an interested third party,” added Petrobras. 
As in previous communications, Petrobras said no decision has been made about its stake in Braskem. 
Braskem, Novonor and Petroquimica Verde have yet to reply to a request for comment at the time of writing.

SINGAPORE (ICIS)–The EU and Indonesia are pursuing a comprehensive economic partnership agreement (CEPA) amid continued uncertainties over US tariffs. 
The deal is expected to be concluded in September, Indonesia’s chief economic minister Airlangga Hartarto said in a post on social media platform X on Monday. 
“The CEPA negotiation process has currently reached the stage of finalizing technical issues, fine-tuning, and developing a more detailed timeline to achieve the ratification stage,” he added. 
The European bloc consisting of 27 countries, and southeast Asia’s biggest economy have “reached a political agreement to advance the trade agreement,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on 13 July. 
Businesses active in agriculture, automotive, and services will “massively benefit from it”, she said. 
The free trade agreement (FTA) will also “help strengthen the supply chains of critical raw materials, essential for Europe’s clean tech and steel industry”, von der Leyen said. 
The EU and Indonesia officially launched negotiations for a CEPA in July 2016. 
“For Indonesia, CEPA is not only about trade, it is about fairness, respect, and building a strong future together,” Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto said in the statement issued by the Commission. 
“The agreement must support our efforts to grow our industries, create jobs, and strengthen our sustainable development goals. We are ready to finalize it soon, in a way that benefits both our peoples.” 
The EU is Indonesia’s fifth-largest trading partner with bilateral trade between them reaching $30.1 billion in 2024, according to data by the European Commission. 
The EU has separate bilateral FTAs with Singapore and Vietnam among ASEAN countries, which took effect in November 2019 and August 2020, respectively. 
Talks to relaunch negotiations with Thailand were announced in March 2023, while negotiations with the Philippines resumed in March 2024.

HOUSTON (ICIS)â€“Mining major BHP announced it will now cost between $7 billion to $7.4 billion for the first stage of the Jansen potash project in Saskatchewan with production reset to begin in mid-2027. 
Stage one of the project is currently 68% completed with the company having already spent $4.5 billion on this phase. 
The development had been expected to cost the company $5.7 billion and was recently targeting a start during 2026. 
BHP said the estimated increases are due to cost escalation pressures, design development and scope changes, and their current assessment of lower productivity outcomes over the construction period. 
It is also considering extending first production from Jansen Stage 2 by two years until 2031. 
This is being done as part of a regular review of capital expenses and given potential for additional supply coming to market in the medium-term.

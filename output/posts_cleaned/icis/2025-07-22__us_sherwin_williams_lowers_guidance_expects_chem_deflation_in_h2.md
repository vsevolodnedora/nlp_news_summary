HOUSTON (ICIS)–Sherwin-Williams expects prices for some of its petrochemical feedstock to decline during the second half of 2025 amid a weakening demand outlook that led the paints and coatings company to lower its earnings and sales guidance for the year. 
The following table compares the company’s latest earnings guidance with its previous one. 
|  **LATEST** |  **PREVIOUS**  
---|---|---  
Net sales  |  Up or down low-single digits  |  Up low-single digits   
Diluted net income/share  |  $10.11-10.41  |  $10.70-11.10   
Adjusted net income/share  |  $11.20-11.50  |  $11.65-12.05

Shares of Sherwin-Williams are down by more than 2%. 
**ARCHITECTURAL VOLUMES WORSE THAN EXPECTED  
** Sherwin-Williams is lowering its guidance in part because architectural sales volumes were softer than expected. In addition, the company has reduced production gallons within its global supply chain, which introduced inefficiencies. 
The overall outlook is for demand to be softer for longer, said Heidi Petz, CEO of Sherwin-Williams. She made her comments during an earnings conference call. 
Mortgage rates will likely end the year at 6.5%, according to Fannie Mae, a US company that buys home loans and securitizes them. 
Mortgage rates need to fall below 6% before the housing market gets a boost, Petz said. 
Demand actually deteriorated in some segments, such as new residential, do-it-yourself (DIY) and coil coatings. 
“To be clear, we expect no help from the market over the remainder of the year,” Petz said. 
**SOFTER DEMAND CONTRIBUTES TO DEFLATION  
** The weaker economic outlook has led Sherwin-Williams to expect costs to decline modestly for some of its raw materials, such as solvents and some of its resins. 
On the other hand, tariffs are pushing costs higher for applicators, extenders, pigments other than titanium dioxide (TiO2) and packaging. Many paint cans are made of steel, and the US has imposed new tariffs on imports of the metal 
Possible tariffs on lumber and other timber products would indirectly affect Sherwin-Williams by raising costs for house construction, a significant end market for its architectural coatings. [ The US started a section 232 investigation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-the-threat-to-national-security-from-imports-of-timber-lumber/) into such imports, and a report is due at the end of November. 
**SHERWIN-WILLIAMS SPEEDS UP COST CUTTING  
** Because of the weaker outlook, Sherwin-Williams is speeding up its earlier cost-cutting plan. The company is now planning on $105 million or 32 cents/share of restructuring initiatives for 2025, up from $50 million or 15 cents/share announced earlier in the year. The program should cut annual costs by $80 million. 
**SHERWIN-WILLIAMS SEES CHANCE TO TAKE MARKET SHARE FROM COMPETITORS  
** Sherwin-Williams’ competitors are contending with the same low-growth outlook, and its largest competitors have made “significant reductions in customer-facing positions and assets”, Petz said, without naming the companies. One unnamed competitor is imposing high single-digit price increases during the middle of the painting season, a move that can disrupt customers’ operations. 
Sherwin-Williams sees these moves by its competitors as an opportunity to capture market share. 
“We continue to believe we are at a major inflection point in the North American architectural coatings industry and we refuse to miss this once-in-a-career opportunity that’s unfolding before us,” Petz said. 
Sherwin-Williams did not discuss any opportunities presented to the company [ by the sale](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00111042121) of PPG’s US and Canadian architectural coatings to American Industrial Partners (AIP).

SINGAPORE (ICIS)–Bank Indonesia (BI) lowered its key interest rate – the seven-day reverse repurchase rate – by 25 basis points (bps) to 5.25% on Wednesday amid a trade deal struck by Indonesia with the US. 
  * Interest rate cut comes amid US trade deal 
  * Need for more household spending, but exports “quite good” 
  * Global economic growth to remain at around 3.0% – BI 


The central bank also lowered overnight deposit rates by 25 bps to 4.50%, and the lending rate by 25 bps to 6.00% amid “the need to continue to stimulate economic growth” as well as a lowered inflation forecast for 2025 and 2026. 
“Going forward, BI will continue to monitor the scope for interest rate reductions to stimulate economic growth while maintaining rupiah (Rp) exchange rate stability and achieving inflation targets in line with the dynamics of the global and domestic economies,” the central bank said. 
Indonesia is southeast Asia’s biggest economy and is a major importer of petrochemicals amid strong demand and limited local production. 
**UNCERTAINTY OVER TARIFFS LOWERS OUTLOOK  
** BI flagged global economic uncertainty rising again based on the US government’s latest ‘reciprocal’ tariffs that are planned to take effect on 1 August. 
As a result of slower economic growth brought about by the US’ tariffs, the central bank projects global economic growth in 2025 to remain weak, at around 3.0%. 
BI also emphasized the importance of stimulating Indonesia’s economic growth amid the weaking global economic outlook. 
The performance of Indonesia’s exports in the second quarter was “quite good”, supported by natural resource-based exports and manufactured products. 
Meanwhile, household consumption still needs to be increased, reflected in slowing retail sales. 
“Looking ahead, economic growth in the second half of 2025 is projected to improve, and overall for 2025 is projected to be in the range of 4.6-5.4%,” BI said. 
Indonesia’s latest GDP growth rate reading – for the first quarter of 2025 – was at 4.87% year on year. 
CPI inflation for Indonesia in June 2025 was recorded at 1.87% year on year, while core inflation fell to 2.37% year on year, said BI. 
**TRADE DEAL  
** Goods from Indonesia to the US will receive a 19% levy, while US imports to Indonesia will not be subject to any duties, US President Donald Trump announced on his social media platform Truth Social. 
The new rate is significantly lower than the previously announced rate of 32%. Transshipments from countries subject to higher rates will be subjected to the higher rate on top of the Indonesia rate. 
In addition, Indonesia apparently committed to $15 billion in US energy purchases, $4.5 billion of American farm products and 50 Boeing jets, according to Trump. 
The US did not specify when the agreement will take effect. 
Hasan Nasbi, who is Indonesia President Prabowo Subianto’s spokesperson, called the deal “an extraordinary struggle” on Wednesday. 
Indonesia had a trade surplus of $17.9 billion with the US in 2024, according to the US trade representative. 
While the levy on Indonesian goods is lower than Vietnam’s 20%, Indonesia’s oleochemicals producers, which form the bulk of Indonesia’s exports to the US, are [ awaiting the announcement](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00111119808) of other rates, notably Malaysia’s. 
Malaysia is also a large oleochemicals exporter and currently has 25% tariffs levied on its goods by the US, to take effect from 1 August unless a trade deal can be reached.

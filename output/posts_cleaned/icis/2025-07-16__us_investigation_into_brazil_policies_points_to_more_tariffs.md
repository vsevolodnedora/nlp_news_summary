HOUSTON (ICIS)–The US has started an investigation into Brazilian policies under Section 301, the same provision it used to impose tariffs on numerous Chinese imports in 2018. 
Any tariffs that the US imposes after it completes the Section 301 tariff could prove more durable than [ the 50% duties it proposed on Brazilian imports](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00111117971) under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Such tariffs are unprecedented, and they are being challenged in US court. 
The US will schedule a hearing about the Section 301 investigation on 3 September. 
**MORE US TARIFFS EXPOSES CHEM EXPORTS TO RETALIATION  
**[Brazil is among the countries](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00111118168) that export benzene to the US, although not to the magnitude of South Korea or the EU. 
By contrast, Brazil is a large importer of caustic soda, polyethylene (PE) and base oils from the US, leaving these products vulnerable to retaliatory tariffs. The US is a minor supplier of fertilizer to Brazil’s large agricultural sector. 
The Brazilian president has not published a response to the US investigation. 
However, Brazil has threatened to invoke its [ economic reciprocity law](https://www.gov.br/planalto/pt-br/acompanhe-o-planalto/noticias/2025/07/decreto-regulamenta-reciprocidade-e-cria-comite-para-deliberar-sobre-contramedidas), which establishes criteria to suspend trade concessions, investments and obligations to intellectual property rights in response to unilateral actions passed by countries that diminish Brazilian competitiveness in global markets. 
It has created a government committee that will consider both countermeasures and negotiations to address the unilateral actions. 
**ALLEGATIONS FROM THE US  
** The US made the following allegations in regards to Brazilian trade practices. 
  * The US accused Brazil of retaliating against companies that allegedly fail to abide to Brazilian policies on political speech. These allegations concern digital trade and electronic payment services, and the US made similar allegations when it proposed 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports. 
  * The US accused Brazil of imposing what it described as lower preferential tariffs on imports from “certain globally competitive trade partners”. The US did not identify the countries, but China is Brazil’s largest trading partner. 
  * The US accused Brazil of failing to enforce anti-corruption and transparency measures. 
  * The US accused Brazil of weak enforcement of intellectual property rights. 
  * The US criticized Brazil for imposing tariffs on its exports of ethanol instead of allowing it to enter duty free. 
  * The US accused Brazil of illegal deforestation, which it alleged undermines the competitiveness of its exports of timber and agricultural products.

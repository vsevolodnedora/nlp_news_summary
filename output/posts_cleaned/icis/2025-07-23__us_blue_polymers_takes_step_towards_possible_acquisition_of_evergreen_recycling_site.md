HOUSTON (ICIS)–US-based Blue Polymers has registered a company at the site of Evergreen Recycling’s plant in Riverside, California, according to a [state filing](https://bizfileonline.sos.ca.gov/api/report/GetImageByNum/082046116217098079042178048079030232029155127201), amid talk that Blue Polymers plans to buy the site. 
Blue Polymers is [the joint venture](https://subscriber.icis.com/search/news/petchem/news-article-00110910506) between waste magnate Republic Services and distribution giant Ravago. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The new company, Blue Polymers Riverside, LLC initially filed a statement of information with the California Secretary of State on 8 July 2025. The mailing address of the new company is the site of Evergreen’s facility in Riverside. 
The fate of the Evergreen Riverside facility has been the center of market speculation for over a year. 
Evergreen had recently announced [the partial closure](https://subscriber.icis.com/search/news/petchem/news-article-00111070910) of the Riverside facility in January, laying off over 50 workers and shutting down bale and flake processing equipment at the end of March. 
Market conditions in California have been particularly difficult for domestic recyclers in recent years. Recycler margins are being squeezed between elevated bale feedstock costs due to export demand from Mexico, and low sales prices due to competition with imported resin. 
Several recyclers in the region have been known to cut production during various downcycles – sometimes by as much as 40%. 
The purchase of the Riverside facility complements existing assets of Republic Services, who have been producing recycled polyethylene terephthalate (R-PET) flake out of their [Las Vegas, Nevada, polymer center](https://subscriber.icis.com/search/news/petchem/news-article-00110951769) since late 2023. Now, flake has a guaranteed end market in the region, though overall R-PET demand conditions in the West Coast remain shaky. 
Republic Services Polymer Centers sort mixed plastic waste and produce R-PET flake, while sending sorted waste polyolefin material to Blue Polymers facilities for further processing. 
Blue Polymers facilities will then flake and pelletize the recycled polypropylene (R-PP) and recycled polyethylene (R-PE) material, to be distributed by Ravago. 
With this potential acquisition, Blue Polymers would also enter the R-PET pellet market. 
The first Blue Polymers facility is now running in Indianapolis, Indiana, and the second in Buckeye, Arizona, is slated to be operational by end of year. 
The [third Republic Services Polymer Center](https://subscriber.icis.com/search/news/petchem/news-article-00111117494) is likely to be Allentown, Pennsylvania, according to a February property sale record to owner Republic Polymers III, though it is unknown if there will be a co-located Blue Polymers facility.

SINGAPORE (ICIS)–Timor-Leste is close to achieving [ full membership in ASEAN](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/news/singapore-backs-timor-lestes-asean-entry-with-estars/?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=dsa_newsletter&utm_medium=email) this November. The oil- and gas-rich country will see opportunities in its petro infrastructure within the broader market and cooperation mechanisms provided by [ASEAN](https://asean.org/). 
Once a membership deal is sealed, Timor-Leste’s energy ministry will spend 2026 pushing for a revised Greater Sunrise development plan – either with original operator Australia’s Woodside Energy or a new Chinese EPC and financier, to secure an FID before the nation’s sovereign fund turns to net withdrawal in the early-2030s. 
Dili’s diplomats would also deepen talks on regional gas integration under [ASCOPE](http://www.ascope.org/)–[TAGP](https://aseanenergy.org/apaec/trans-asean-gas-pipeline/), positioning the proposed Timor Leste-based [Beaçu](https://www.laohamutuk.org/Oil/TasiMane/Beacu/15Beacu.htm) facility as a future trans-shipment or bunkering hub for intra-ASEAN LNG. 
**BAYU-UNDAN TO SUNRISE MOMENTUM**
Timor-Leste is one of the world’s youngest nations – having gained independence only in 2002. The country, approximately the size of the US state of Connecticut or South Korea’s Jeju Island, is rich in offshore oil and gas reserves. 
The nation’s $19 billion sovereign wealth [ Petroleum Fund](https://www.mof.gov.tl/pagedetails/petroleum-fund-of-timor-leste) has been largely based on oil revenues – with the legacy [ Bayu-Undan field](https://lngedge.icis.com/news/article/11043857) funding more than 85% of the fund’s balance. Bayu-Undan’s gas sales ceased in late-2023 and will be fully decommissioned in 2026. 
Bayu-Undan carries high hope for Timor Leste and Australian producer Santos as a “CCS hub” that receives CO2 from Australia, and Japan and South Korea, whose companies hold a combined 38.3% [ share.](https://www.santos.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Santos-concludes-negotiations-for-TIMOR-GAPs-entry-into-the-Bayu-Undan-joint-venture.pdf)
Therefore, Timor-Leste is set to further tap into its petro-molecule reserves by granting generous incentives to oil and gas foreign direct investments once accession to ASEAN is completed. 
Timor GAP E.P., Timor-Leste’s national oil company, holds over half (56.56%) equity in the Woodside-operated (33.44%) [ Greater Sunrise LNG complex](https://www.timorgap.com/our-business/upstream/greater-sunrise/#:~:text=The%20Greater%20Sunrise%20development,%20located%20approximately%20140%20km,of%20gas%20and%20226%20million%20barrels%20of%20condensate.), Japan’s Osaka Gas has the remaining 10% stake. 
Dili insists Sunrise gas must land on its south coast at a planned Beaçu LNG complex, part of the $12 billion [ Tasi Mane corridor](https://www.timorgap.com/our-business/south-coast-project/), while [Woodside prefers piping it](https://lngedge.icis.com/news/article/9511569) to the existing [Darwin LNG](https://lngedge.icis.com/port/218) plant or as a floating unit to cut capex. 
President José Ramos-Horta told local media in May he was courting Chinese partners “if the current operator cannot move forward,” signalling the government’s willingness to look beyond traditional Australian and Japanese partners.

**ASEAN MEMBERSHIP**
Full ASEAN status will grant Timor-Leste access to the ASEAN Council on Petroleum and the Trans-ASEAN Gas Pipeline (TAGP) master plan, which stipulates technical standards and opens concessional funding from the ASEAN Infrastructure Fund. 
Meanwhile, pipe and heavy equipment sourced within ASEAN and LNG modules sold in the region could enjoy Most-Favoured-Nation duties once Timor-Leste signs the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement. 
ASEAN’s mature regional cooperation mechanisms, particularly within [ ASEAN+3 framework](https://asean.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Final-JMS-of-21st-AMEM3.pdf), can provide Timor-Leste with financing instruments from Japanese, Chinese and Korean banks. 
Dili hopes those levers will attract partners for Greater Sunrise, as well as for smaller prospects such as the [ Chuditch gas survey](https://sundaenergy.com/projects/timor-leste-chuditch-project/), where a 3D seismic study is scheduled this year. 
These projects are all still long way to materialising, but ASEAN membership would give the micro-state a bigger table to convert offshore molecules into on-shore assets before the Bayu-Undan money runs out. 
**COMPETIVE LANDSCAPE SPLIT WITH PNG LNG**
Timor’s ambitions is naturally comparable with [Papua New Guinea LNG](https://pnglng.com/about/Project-overview), a 7.9 mtpa project that turned the resource-rich but infrastructure-poor [neighbour](https://lngedge.icis.com/country/218) into a top regional exporter in 2014. 
PNG’s experience shows that early identification of anchor buyers in Japan or China – and multilateral lending from ADB and Export-Import banks – can accelerate first gas. 
But it also highlights social-license challenges, something Timor-Leste is keen to avoid after decades of hard-won stability.

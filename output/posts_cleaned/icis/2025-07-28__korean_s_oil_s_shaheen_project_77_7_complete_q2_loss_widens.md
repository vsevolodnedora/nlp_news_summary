SINGAPORE (ICIS)–South Korean S-Oil’s thermal crude-to-chemical project in Ulsan is now 77.7% complete and is on track for mechanical completion in H1 2026, even as the company’s Q2 net loss widened. 
As of 16 July, major towers of the project called “Shaheen” – Arabic for “falcon” – had been installed, with installation of cracking heater in progress, the South Korean refiner said on 25 July. 
Installations of the thermal crude-to-chemical (TC2C) reactor and key units, as well as linear low density polyethylene and high-density polyethylene (LLDPE/HDPE) reactors & extruders were all completed, it added. 
S-Oil is 63%-owned by Saudi Aramco, the world’s biggest exporter of crude oil. 
The company’s Q2 net loss widened to South Korean won (W) 66.8 billion ($48 million) as its petrochemical business swung into an operating loss of W34.6 billion from a profit of W109.9 billion in the same period last year.

Compared with Q1, Q2 paraxylene (PX) market rebounded on fresh demand from a new purified terephthalic acid (PTA) facility in China and benzene market weakened due to reduce US imports following the imposition of tariffs. 
Polypropylene (PP) and propylene oxide (PO) markets recovered amid tighter supply from regional maintenance and easing tension between the US and China. 
For Q3, the company expects PX to be firm due to plant turnarounds and start-ups of new downstream PTA facilities, with the benzene market likely to be resilient, as demand from new downstream facilities offsets decreased US imports. 
PP and PO markets may remain supported as tariff uncertainties fade, despite ongoing capacity additions in China, the company predicts.

HOUSTON (ICIS)–Dow cut its dividend by 50% on Thursday because the downturn in the chemical industry is entering its third year and it will last longer than expected. 
Shares of Dow fell by more than 16% in midday trading. 
Earlier on Thursday, Dow reported a [ Q2 net loss of $801 million](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00111121926). 
**DOW Q3 SALES TO FALL YEAR ON YEAR  
** Looking ahead at Q3, Dow expects sales to rise slightly from Q2 levels, but they will remain below year-ago levels, as shown in the following table. Figures are in dollars. 
|  Q3 25  |  Q2 25  |  Q3 24   
---|---|---|---  
Net sales  |  10.2 billion  |  10.1 billion  |  10.9 billion   
Operating EBITDA  |  800 million  |  703 million  |  1,382 million

Dow expects a quarter-on-quarter bump in sales in part because of proposed price increases for polyethylene (PE). Exports have started to resume, and Dow is confident that the proposed hikes will go through because it maintains that integrated margins are low and unsustainable. 
Dow should get another boost in Q3 earnings [ from the startup of its new Poly 7 PE line](https://subscriber.icis.com/search/news/petchem/news-article-00111106864) in Freeport, Texas. 
The train is fully sold out, and Dow is selling the output to higher-margin markets such as food and specialty packaging as well as health and hygiene, said Karen Carter, chief operating officer. The train should provide another boost to earnings by absorbing Dow’s last remnant of merchant ethylene in the Gulf Coast market. 
The new line and the possible price increase would follow what Dow described as the evaporation of PE exports in the wake of the 2 April tariff announcements. The disappearance of exports led to a 3 cents/lb drop in PE prices. 
The fallout from the tariff announcements showed up in Dow’s earnings for its Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, which reported a 90% year-on-year decline in operating earnings before interest and tax (EBIT). 
Overall, Dow’s end markets are mixed at best, as shown in the following heat map from the company.

Dow has maintained its forecast for mid-cycle earnings, but the company delayed when it would achieve those levels. That could take place near 2030, which was the latter part of an earlier forecast made by Dow. 
That said, the company warned that the timing of any recovery is difficult because of the uncertainty surrounding tariffs and trade negotiations and what CEO Jim Fitterling described as “a new world order” and trade rebalancing. 
Concluding trade negotiations would be a first step towards a recovery, and it appears the US is getting close to wrapping up talks, he said during the company’s earnings conference call. 
**TRADE, OVERSUPPLY AND GEOPOLITICS  
** One of the reasons why earnings will remain depressed for longer is because tensions and tariffs are re-arranging trade routes. 
Derivatives, more so than chemicals, are being redirected from the US to other markets, Fitterling said. 
ICIS has reported on the effects of these redirected derivative shipments on chemical markets in southeast Asia, and they have depressed demand for upstream plastics and chemicals. 
Dow’s international trade operations are managing tariff negotiations through their connections with governments around the world, Fitterling said. 
Also, there is work going on through the World Trade Organization (WTO) involving how goods are moved around and how to defend fair trade, Fitterling said. Trade organizations and individual companies are pursuing this option. 
Countries are starting to take action as well. [ Brazil is considering](https://subscriber.icis.com/search/news/petchem/news-article-00111105536) anti-dumping duties on PE imports from the US and Canada. 
The EU has started investigations on imports of [ butanediol](https://subscriber.icis.com/search/news/petchem/news-article-00111109136) (BDO), [ polyethylene terephthalate](https://subscriber.icis.com/search/news/petchem/news-article-00111120634) (PET) and [ adipic acid](https://subscriber.icis.com/search/news/petchem/news-article-00111085197) (ADA). 
Downstream, countries have imposed duties on electric vehicles (EVs). 
**WORLD WORKS THROUGH EXCESS CAPACITY  
** Dow expects the world will work through excess PE capacity because demand should continue growing faster than GDP, Fitterling said. “I don’t think you are looking at an environment where it’s the end of investing in plastics.” 
The polyurethanes chain has a lot of overcapacity, and demand is low for several of its key markets, such as construction and durable goods. 
Isocyanates are in relatively decent shape, Fitterling said. Propylene oxide (PO) will take longer to rebalance. 
Silicones continue to grow well, but siloxanes will take longer. 
**OTHER CHEM FIRMS SEE NO HELP FROM ECONOMY  
** Earlier in the week, paints and coatings producer Sherwin-Williams [ lowered its guidance](https://subscriber.icis.com/search/news/petchem/news-article-00111121049) and warned that any growth would come from taking market share away from its competitors. The company expected no help from the economy. 
Adhesives producer [ HB Fuller raised its guidance](https://subscriber.icis.com/search/news/petchem/news-article-00111114248), but its rationale confirmed the pessimistic outlook of Sherwin-Williams and Dow. 
HB Fuller raised its guidance because of the success of its self-help measures and not because of a stronger economy.

SINGAPORE (ICIS)–ChemOne Group has secured $350 million in Islamic insurance cover, paving the way for Islamic banks to finance the $5.3 billion Pengerang Energy Complex (PEC) in Malaysia, the Singapore-based petrochemicals firm said on Tuesday. 
The Islamic Corporation for the Insurance of Investment and Export Credit (ICIEC), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB), has approved an insurance cover of $350 million for the PEC, ChemOne Group said. 
The ICIEC cover is structured under a Murabaha financing facility, providing 90% cover on both principle and profit and aligning with significantly de-risking the transaction for participating Islamic banks, the firm added. 
The Islamic banks include: 
  * National Bank of Kuwait (NBK) 
  * Qatar National Bank (QNB) 
  * Al Rajhi Bank Malaysia 
  * Al Rajhi Bank KSA 


Additionally, the IsDB Group has committed $150 million in direct investment via Istisna (manufacturing or construction contract) and Ijara (leasing contract) structures. 
Between direct investments and credit enhancement, the IsDB has supported the PEC with over $500 million, said ChemOne Group. 
The groundbreaking of the [ PEC project](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00111060056) is expected to take place in Q4 2025 following financial close by the end of Q3 this year, a ChemOne spokesperson told ICIS on Tuesday. 
The Pengerang Energy Complex is slated to begin operations by the first quarter of 2029, the spokesperson said. 
The project has been beset by delays since 2020 due to “complex financing issues”, according to the project operator. Construction was previously [ set to begin](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00111060056) in mid-2025 after $3.5 billion in funding was found in Dec 2024. 
Located within the Pengerang Integrated Petroleum Complex (PIPC) in Johor, the 6.5 million tonne/year PEC is capable of processing 150,000 barrels/day of condensate plus side feed of naphtha, that will in turn produce 2.6 million tonnes/year of aromatics, 3 million tonnes/year of energy products and hydrogen output of 50,000 tonnes/year. 
In May this year, ChemOne Group’s Vice President for Technology Mobin Rahman said the complex would [ utilize bionaphtha ](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00111103487)as a feedstock for the PEC, creating a circular and sustainable petrochemical chain.

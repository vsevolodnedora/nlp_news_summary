SINGAPORE (ICIS)–Click [here](https://www.icis.com/asian-chemical-connections/2025/07/pros-and-cons-for-the-eu-of-the-trade-deal-with-the-us/) to see the latest blog post on Asian Chemical Connections by John Richardson: The US-EU trade deal, setting a 15% baseline tariff, is generating mixed reactions across Europe. Is this truly a “good” deal, or simply essential damage control? 
My latest blog post dives into the nuances, weighing the gains against the significant costs for the European economy. This, of course, comes at a time of major restructuring pressure on European petrochemicals. As the dust settles, further posts will assess what the deal could mean this particular European industry. 
Key Pros for Europe: 
  * Averted Trade War Catastrophe: Successfully avoided the threatened 30% US tariffs and massive EU retaliation, preventing severe economic turmoil and widespread supply chain disruption. 
  * Restored Stability & Predictability: The 15% baseline offers a clearer cost structure for businesses, aiding long-term planning amidst ongoing uncertainty. 
  * Maintained Crucial Market Access: Despite higher costs, European goods (like automobiles) retain access to the vital US market, averting potential exclusion. 
  * Strategic Sector Protection: “Zero-for-zero” tariffs secured for key high-value sectors like aircraft, certain chemicals, generic drugs, and semiconductor equipment. 
  * Preserved Transatlantic Ties: Maintained a crucial diplomatic relationship vital for broader global cooperation. 


Key Cons for Europe: 
  * Higher Overall Tariff Burden: 15% is significantly above historical averages, imposing a new, ongoing cost burden on European exporters. 
  * Increased Costs: US importers face higher costs, either leading to increased consumer prices or reduced European profit margins. 
  * Impact on Key Export Sectors: Automakers, for example, face reduced competitiveness and potential acceleration of costly reshoring efforts. 
  * Unresolved Tariffs & Concessions: 50% US tariffs on steel/aluminium remain, while Europe has pledged substantial US LNG & military equipment purchases, plus major investments. 
  * Fragmented Trade Landscape: The deal creates a patchwork of tariffs, not a return to free trade, and highlights Europe’s defensive, limited negotiating position. 


This agreement underscores the ongoing fragility of global trade relations. It’s a pragmatic retreat to safeguard the broader economic relationship.

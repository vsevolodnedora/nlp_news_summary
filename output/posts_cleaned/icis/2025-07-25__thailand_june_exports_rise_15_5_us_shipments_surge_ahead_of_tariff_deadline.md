SINGAPORE (ICIS)–Thailand’s overall exports in June grew by 15.5% year on year to $28.6 billion on front-loading of shipments ahead of the US’ 36% tariffs, which will take effect on 1 August. 
  * June exports to US surge by 42% year on year 
  * Military conflict with Cambodia; domestic political instability dog government 
  * 2025 GDP growth projected to slow to 2.3% from 2.5% in 2024 


Although June was the 12th straight month of export growth for the southeast Asian nation, the pace of expansion eased from 18.4% in May. 
Total shipments to the US – Thailand’s largest exports destination – surged in June by 41.9% year on year, according to data released by the Ministry of Commerce on 24 July. 
Thailand’s overall imports rose by 13.1% year on year to $27.5 billion in May, resulting in a trade surplus of $1.06 billion. 
During the first six months of the year, exports rose by 15.0% to $66.8 billion, while imports increased at a slower pace of 11.6% to $66.9 billion. 
However, this run may not last as front-loading momentum may ease once the US tariffs come into force. Thailand has yet to reach a trade deal with the US on bringing down the tariffs from 36%. 
Exports are expected to remain positive, but the growth rate would ease from double-digit levels in the next five months to December, said Poonpong Naiyanapakorn, director-general of Thailand’s Trade Policy and Strategy Office (TPSO). 
**US TARIFF DEADLINE APPROACHES**  
Thailand and the US have yet to come to a trade agreement, raising pressure on the government at a time when the country’s Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra was suspended due to a leaked call in which she criticised the Thai military. 
Phumtham Wechayachai is currently the Acting Prime Minister of Thailand, while Deputy Prime Minister and finance minister Pichai Chunhavajira is heading trade talks with the US. 
The southeast Asian country is experiencing further instability amid a border clash with Cambodia, during which armed clashes and rocket fire were reported on the morning of 24 July. Thai fighter jets were deployed in response to the rocket fire and at least 12 have been killed, according to media reports on 24 July. 
Both sides have accused each other of starting the 24 July conflict, centering around historically disputed border regions of Surin in Thailand and the Cambodian province of Oddar Meanchey. 
On Friday, the Thai army requested people to stay away from border areas as fighting intensifies. 
“Aside from uncertainty around US trade policies, the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East and domestic political instability could pose additional threats to the Thai economy,” the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said in a report on 23 July. 
The Thai economy is projected to expand at a slower rate of 2.3% in 2025 and of 1.7% in 2026, the Bank of Thailand (BOT) said in its last monetary policy meeting on 25 June. In 2024, actual GDP growth was 2.5%. 
Meanwhile, the ADB projects a much slower growth of 1.8% for Thailand in 2025, which would further decelerate to 1.6% in 2026.

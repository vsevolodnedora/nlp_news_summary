SINGAPORE (ICIS)–Click [here](https://www.icis.com/asian-chemical-connections/2025/07/china-three-scenarios-for-the-trade-war-its-economy-and-petrochemicals/) to see the latest blog post on Asian Chemical Connections by John Richardson: Trade tensions between China and major global economies are shaping the future of the world’s second-largest economy. What’s next for China’s GDP, unemployment, inflation, and of course petrochemicals? 
I’ve outlined three “back-of-the-envelope” scenarios to help kickstart your strategic planning, focusing on trends and magnitudes rather than specific numbers. 
  * **Best Case: Comprehensive De-escalation & Broad Agreements**


Outlook: A diplomatic breakthrough leading to robust GDP growth, easing youth unemployment, and an inflationary recovery. Exports rebound strongly. 
Petrochemicals: Increased trade stability, potential for margin rebound, though China’s demand growth recalibrates to a lower, more sustainable pace post-property bubble. 
  * **Medium Case: Protracted Stalemate & Selective De-escalation**


Outlook: A “muddle through” period with moderate GDP slowdown, persistently elevated youth unemployment, and ongoing deflationary pressures. Export growth remains sluggish. 
Petrochemicals: Continued trade route shifts, no major margin recovery from trade alone, and an accelerated push for China’s self-sufficiency. 
  * **Worst Case: Full-Blown Trade War & Deep Decoupling**


Outlook: Sharp GDP contraction, a severe unemployment crisis (especially for youth), and entrenched deflation. Exports collapse, leading to aggressive state stimulus. 
Petrochemicals: Severe disruption, near-cessation of key trade flows (eg, US LPG/ethane), further margin deterioration, and an urgent drive for national security-prioritized self-sufficiency in China. 
Even in the best case, remember China faces structural headwinds from the property market and an ageing population, which will temper growth.

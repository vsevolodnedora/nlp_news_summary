HOUSTON (ICIS)–The US is approaching a 1 August deadline to conclude tariff negotiations with several countries, after which it will likely proceed with more duties on specific products such as lumber, copper and pharmaceuticals. 
Earnings for US chemicals have already fallen because of the uncertainty caused by US trade policy. 
[ Dow cut its dividend in half](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00111121979) and reported a Q2 net loss of $801 million after proposed tariffs caused exports of polyethylene (PE) to evaporate in April. 
Olin warned that it is vulnerable to retaliatory tariffs that Brazil could impose on US imports of caustic soda. 
**WHERE NATIONAL TARIFFS STAND  
** The US has already reached frameworks with Japan and the EU, two of its major trading partners. Talks are ongoing with India, South Korea, Canada, Mexico and Brazil as the US approaches a 1 August deadline to conclude talks. 
The following table shows the tariffs that the US proposed and the subsequent trade agreements that it announced. 
Country  |  Proposed rate  |  Trade Deal   
---|---|---  
Algeria  |  30%  |  pending   
Bangladesh  |  35%  |  pending   
Bosnia and Herzegovina  |  30%  |  pending   
Brazil  |  50%  |  pending   
Brunei  |  25%  |  pending   
Cambodia  |  36%  |  pending   
Canada  |  35%  |  pending   
EU  |  30%  |  15%   
Indonesia  |  32%  |  19%   
Iraq  |  30%  |  pending   
Japan  |  25%  |  15%   
Kazakhstan  |  25%  |  pending   
Laos  |  40%  |  pending   
Libya  |  30%  |  pending   
Malaysia  |  25%  |  pending   
Mexico  |  30%  |  pending   
Moldova  |  25%  |  pending   
Myanmar (Burma)  |  40%  |  pending   
Philippines  |  20%  |  19%   
Serbia  |  35%  |  pending   
South Africa  |  30%  |  pending   
South Korea  |  25%  |  pending   
Sri Lanka  |  30%  |  pending   
Thailand  |  36%  |  pending   
Tunisia  |  25%  |  pending   
On 12 August, the US will reach another deadline to reach a trade agreement with China to prevent the two countries from reviving triple digit tariff increases. 
The US proposed these tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). A pending court case could eliminate the legal basis for the IEEPA-based tariffs. 
If the courts overturn the national tariffs, the US could resort to other provisions to introduce new duties, although this will take time and they may not be as broad as the IEEPA-based tariffs. 
**US PROPOSES POLITICAL TARIFFS ON BRAZIL  
** The US proposed tariffs on Brazilian imports were an exception because they were based on the nation’s politics. The US actually has a trade surplus with Brazil, unlike the other nations that were targets for tariffs. 
The US use of tariffs to influence other countries’ policies creates the possibility that it could employ similar tactics to other countries – even if it already negotiated trade agreements. 
**WHERE SECTORAL TARIFFS STAND  
** The US is also considering tariffs on product families under section 232. These tariffs are not covered by the IEEPA lawsuit so they will prove more durable. 
Under section 232, the government investigates whether imports of specific products threaten national security. The US has 270 days to file a report on the investigation, after which the president can choose to impose tariffs or take other actions in response to the findings of the report. 
The following table summarizes the pending section 232 investigations and the deadlines to complete them. 
Product  |  Start of investigation  |  Report Due   
---|---|---  
Copper  |  10-Mar  |  5-Dec   
Timber, lumber  |  10-Mar  |  5-Dec   
Semiconductors  |  1-Apr  |  27-Dec   
Pharmaceuticals  |  1-Apr  |  27-Dec   
Medium duty trucks  |  22-Apr  |  17-Jan   
Heavy duty trucks  |  22-Apr  |  17-Jan   
Critical minerals  |  22-Apr  |  17-Jan   
Commercial aircraft  |  1-May  |  26-Jan   
Jet engines  |  1-May  |  26-Jan   
Polysilicon  |  1-Jul  |  28-Mar   
Unmanned aircraft systems  |  1-Jul  |  28-Mar

The US has also broadened and increased tariffs on previously completed investigations, as shown in the following table. 
Product  |  Tariff   
---|---  
Automobiles  |  25%   
Auto parts  |  25%   
Steel  |  50%   
Aluminium  |  50%

These tariffs have exceptions based on the country of origin and their portion of domestically produced content. 
**CHINESE TRADE RESTRICTIONS PERSIST  
** The US and China had opened a new front in their trade war by restricting exports of critical materials. 
China had since resumed shipments of rare earth minerals, and the US is allowing exports of ethane, a feedstock that some Chinese crackers use to make ethylene. 
However, China has apparently maintained restrictions on other critical minerals minerals. 
Among them, antimony is used as a catalyst to make polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and bismuth metal is used as a catalyst for polyurethanes and as a radiopaque additive for plastics used in medical devices. 
[ Since 3 December](https://www.mofcom.gov.cn/zwgk/zcfb/art/2024/art_3d5e990b43424e60828030f58a547b60.html), China has banned the export of the following minerals: 
  * Antimony 
  * Gallium 
  * Germanium 


This strengthened the restrictions on antimony shipments that China [ imposed on 15 September 2024](https://www.mofcom.gov.cn/zwgk/zcfb/art/2024/art_a4711acb06364199a3c5a06d7f2be6d8.html). 
[ Since 4 February](https://www.mofcom.gov.cn/zwgk/zcfb/art/2025/art_e623090907fc4e1092f0a4db72f57b95.html), China has restricted shipments on the following minerals: 
  * Bismuth 
  * Molybdenum 
  * Indium 
  * Tellurium 
  * Tungsten 


**US TARIFFS SLOW GROWTH, PARALYZE DECISION MAKING  
** The on-again, off-again nature of US tariffs and their vague characteristics have injected uncertainty into the economy, causing companies and consumers to delay purchases and investment decisions. 
When the US does make an announcement about tariff rates, it is done on the president’s social media page with few details. 
Chemical companies have said that uncertainty has caused more disruptions to their businesses than the actual tariffs. They also do not know if their sizeable exports will be subject to retaliatory tariffs. 
All of this slows growth, and economists have lowered their forecasts for 2025 GDP following the tariff announcements. 
Businesses need certainty so they can plan, especially for small companies that bring in a couple of containers each quarter, said Eric Byer, president and CEO of the Alliance for Chemical Distribution (ACD). 
If the US can reach agreements with China, India, Canada and Mexico by the Labor Day holiday in September, that could go a long way in providing certainty to the economy, Byer said. 
The US needs to resolve its trade disputes soon because retailers and consumers will start planning for upcoming holidays, such as Halloween at the end of October and Christmas at the end of December, Byer said.

  * Market experts told ICIS that BESS operators are more likely to opt for a hybrid bidding strategy at the first Italian MACSE auction 
  * This would involve a diversified BESS portfolio partly safeguarded by the low-risk MACSE premium, and partly benefiting from merchant market upside 
  * Italian power spot spreads are likely to increase, rendering the merchant market more remunerative, a source from KYOS told ICIS 


LONDON (ICIS)– Multiple market experts, including a source from KYOS Energy Consulting, have told ICIS that BESS operators are likely to opt for a hybrid bidding strategy at the first MACSE (Electricity Storage Capacity Procurement) auction on 30 September, covering some of their fixed costs with MACSE incentives and leaving the rest of their battery storage portfolio free to take part in the merchant market. 
The source from KYOS told ICIS that “a ‘full-MACSE strategy’ is probably not the way to go for operators, as it would involve missing too much of an opportunity from wholesale trading. Instead, a hybrid MACSE strategy is likely what most operators will want to go for.” 
The same source suggested that “as long as solar buildout outpaces BESS deployment, we are likely to see day-ahead spreads increasing, together with the arbitrage potential from buying low at midday and selling high in the evening.” 
“Consequently, I don’t think an operator would want to lock themselves into a ‘full-MACSE’ scheme which leaves them unable to take advantage of these increasing spreads,” the same source concluded. 
An Italian power market analyst agreed with this assessment, suggesting that “it is likely that operators will opt for a hybrid strategy as different studies indicate this as the most remunerative; it allows a portion of the earnings of a BESS portfolio to be safeguarded by the MACSE scheme while leaving the other part to benefit from arbitrage on the merchant market.” 
“FULL MACSE” 
The [ MACSE mechanism](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/energy/news-article-00111096995) offers newly constructed storage facilities long-term contracts that ensure a premium in €/MWh/year, received on a monthly basis for 15 years. 
In exchange, operators must use their storage capacity to provide time-shifting services as well as participate in the Ancillary Services Market (MSD). Operators will be able to retain 20% of the revenue earned on the MSD. 
According to an Italian BESS expert, this makes a ‘full-MACSE’ strategy the most likely choice for “totally risk-averse operators; it provides regular and certain revenue, less profitability with less risk.” 
MERCHANT MARKET 
On the other hand, the same BESS expert told ICIS that “operators more prone to risk are likely to expose some of their BESS portfolio on the merchant market and/or the capacity market.” 
The same BESS expert noted that, as the first MACSE auction does not offer incentives for northern zones, “BESS portfolios could be diversified with MACSE projects in the south and capacity market projects in the north.” 
HYBRID STRATEGY 
On the other hand, a head of power origination told ICIS that “at the level of potential merchant market revenue, Italy is one of the least enticing countries in Europe, given that negative prices do not form on its power market.” 
The MACSE approach likely to be the most popular, an Italian market regulatory specialist told ICIS, could be “a hybrid strategy with a diversified BESS portfolio.” 
This would balance the higher upside offered by the merchant market with the low-risk, regular MACSE monthly premium. 
OUTLOOK 
The post-2028 horizon poses the threat of “battery cannibalization” – the new BESS capacity contracted by MACSE could reduce price spreads, thus cannibalizing battery arbitrage margins. 
However, the source from KYOS told ICIS that “in the near future there will be more liquidity on the intraday market, and the wholesale market will hold a more significant share of revenue stream for BESS operators.” 
“As more BESS capacity comes online, we expect profits on ancillary markets to decrease as these markets become more saturated (because of their relatively smaller depth), causing operators to shift their focus to merchant markets,” the source concluded.

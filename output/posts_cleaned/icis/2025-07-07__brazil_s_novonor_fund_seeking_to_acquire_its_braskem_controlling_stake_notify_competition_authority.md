SAO PAULO (ICIS)–Braskem’s controlling stakeholder Novonor and the potential buyer for its stake at the Brazilian petrochemicals major have notified competition authority CADE about the transaction seeking approval. 
In May, Brazilian entrepreneur Nelson Tanure’s investment fund Petroquimica Verde launched a [non-binding acquisition offer](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00111104112) for Novonor’s 38.3% stake in Braskem, which gives it however 50.1% of voting rights. 
Monday’s move represents the furthest an acquisition offer for Novonor’s stake has gotten, after several potential buyers ultimately ended up backing off. 
Braskem’s second-largest shareholder is the country’s state-owned energy major Petrobras, with a 36.1% stake and 47.0% of voting rights. 
Novonor, formerly Odebrecht, has for years tried to divest the stake as it aims to deleverage after the company got embroiled in the Latin America-wide Lava Jato corruption scandal in the mid-2010s. 
Names such as Abu Dhabi’s oil company Adnoc, US chemicals major LyondellBasell, or Brazilian players such as Unipar and J&F made offers for Novonor’s stake but ultimately backed off. 
Most of the potential buyers ended up desisting because of Braskem’s heavy-weight legacy related to the environmental disaster caused by one of its salt mines in the state of Alagoas in 2018, which left many homeless and/or displaced. 
“NSP Investimentos [Novonor’s parent company], in Judicial Reorganization, and Petroquimica Verde Fundo de Investimento em Participaçes – Multiestrategia notified the Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) requesting the authorization of the competition authority for a potential transaction involving the shares issued by NSP Investimentos,” said Braskem. 
“Novonor also informed that until this date, no definitive binding agreements have been executed in relation to the eventual transaction, which remains subject to the usual assessments and confirmations in similar transactions.” 
Braskem’s stock in the Sao Paulo exchange rose by nearly 1.5% in the early morning following the announcement, although by midday local time the gains had moderated and was up nearly 0.50%. 
In a written response to ICIS, a spokesperson for Novonor said the company would not comment further. 
Petroquimica Verde had not responded to a request for further comment at the time of writing.

  * EU-US trade deal to include $750 billion in energy strategic-sector purchases 
  * Experts doubt objectives can be met 
  * Further details to be “sorted out” in coming weeks 


LONDON (ICIS)–The EU agreed to purchase $750 billion in strategic sectors, including gas, oil, nuclear fuel and AI chips over three years, as part of a trade deal announced on 27 July. 
However, experts have cast doubts about whether the overall figures can be achieved, as well as the timings for replacing Russian fuels, while market reaction was muted in the aftermath of the announcement. 
European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen told reporters the agreement would amount to $250 billion per year for the remain three years of US president Donald Trump’s term. 
She said this would help the EU replace Russian oil and gas, which the bloc has proposed to phase out by 2027. 
The bloc also intends to end Russian supply of nuclear fuels, but the plans and end date for this have not yet been released. 
The deal also imposes a 15% US import tariff on most EU goods, avoiding a threatened 30% rate ahead of a 1 August deadline. 
Von der Leyen described the agreement as a framework deal, meaning it would involve the publicly announced figures, but the “details have to be sorted out and that will happen over the next weeks”. 
The announcement did not clarify how the $750 billion would be split between the identified sectors. 
ANALYSIS 
Andreas Schroeder, head of gas analytics at ICIS, described the $250 billion annual target as unrealistic. 
“As the global LNG market has a value of just little over $200 billion at current prices, it is hard to imagine how US LNG exports to EU alone can help bringing value anywhere close to $250 billion [per year],” Schroeder said. 
Gas expert Anne-Sophie Corbeau said on LinkedIn that the agreement did not make sense and would require the EU to triple its purchases of US energy, accounting for current exchange rates. 
Total EU energy imports from the US were around $70 billion in 2024, according to Eurostat. 
“The EU needs to import a lot more in volumes, diverting away from [other suppliers], while assuming that oil and gas prices will remain high/increase,” she said while noting Europe is trying to lower energy costs and Trump wants cheaper oil. 
Corbeau also underlined the political agreement would not force markets’ hands. 
“And always remember, neither the [European Commission] nor the [White House] can dictate where super flexible US LNG goes,” she said. 
The US exported around 2.4 billion MMBtu of LNG to the EU over the last twelve months, according to ICIS LNG analyst Alex Froley. 
These US exports to the EU – at current prices of about $11/MMBtu – would equate to roughly $75 billion over three years, or around $25 billion/year. 
This means the EU could hit around 10% of its $750 billion target through purchases of LNG, at current rates of imports and prices. 
“US output will expand further over that period, which could allow some additional increase in purchases, but unlikely by a very large amount,” Froley added. Additionally, ICIS forecasts European TTF prices to decline going into 2026-2027 due to global oversupply. 
MARKET MOVES 
The deals announcement had limited impact on benchmark TTF gas prices. 
TTF August ’25 contracts shed value in early trade, slumping to €32/MWh around 12:00 London time before retracing their losses in the afternoon.

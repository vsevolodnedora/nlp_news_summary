SAO PAULO (ICIS)–The latest US tariffs on Brazilian goods due to come into force on 1 August are related to “political” issues rather than trade and could still be revised or revoked, according to credit ratings agency Moody’s. 
John Rogers, senior vice president and head analyst for chemicals at Moody’s, said a revision to US tariffs is also likely due to their political nature and the fact that Brazil does not have a surplus in goods trade with the US – with the US running an even larger surplus than the average. 
When announcing the tariffs last week, US President Donald Trump justified them for what he described as a “witch hunt” against former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is on trial for an alleged coup attempt in January 2023. 
“We don’t have a house view on the macroeconomic impact yet. I think the situation is very fluid, but in the past few months, we have had several announcements that were later revoked or revised. Hopefully, everything gets resolved before 1 August but, if not, I think the impact on both the US and Brazil is going to be significant,” said Rogers. 
“From the corporate side we can say that this, for sure. It adds challenges and uncertainties to business decisions, to investment decisions, to global trade and to prices. Ultimately, this would have an impact on demand which is already depressed. Not only for Brazil in general, but for the chemical sector globally.” 
Rogers said although most US tariffs are being directed at countries that have a trade surplus with the US, it is not the case for Brazil. 
Not only does the US have a large trade surplus with Brazil, it also enjoys a trade surplus in chemicals, according to chemicals trade group Abiquim. Last year, Brazil [posted a significant trade deficit](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00111118195) with the US – importing $10.4 billion worth of chemicals, but exporting just $2.4 billion. 
“Most of the tariffs we are seeing are directed to countries that have trade surpluses with the US – Brazil does not have one,” Rogers pointed out. 
Many in Brazil’s industrial sector expect the [crisis to be sorted out](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00111118167) well before the 1 August deadline – and do not expect the tariffs to be implemented – at least not by the damaging percentages announced earlier. 
“We simply need this to be reversed and we think it will be reversed very soon. Otherwise, this will be a big impact on us here in Brazil: 20% of our exports are destined for the US,” said a source in the powerful food sector, a large consumer of polymers. 
“We’re not even counting on this becoming a reality in August. We’re counting on this to be resolved sooner.” 
However, the more pessimistic expect GDP growth to be hit by about half a percentage point over the next three years. 
“Our Tariff Impact Model indicates that a 50% US import tariff could exert a hit of about 0.6% on Brazil’s GDP over a three-year period. We suspect that the impact would be mitigated by a fall in the real – it declined by about 2.5% against the dollar yesterday and we expect a further depreciation this year – and some redirection of exports to other markets,” said analysts at Capital Economics. 
“That might leave the impact in the order of 0.3-0.5% of GDP. So, it is not an enormous hit, but also not helpful at a time when the economy appears to be slowing sharply.”

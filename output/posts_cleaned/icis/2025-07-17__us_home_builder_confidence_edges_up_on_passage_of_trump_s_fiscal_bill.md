HOUSTON (ICIS)–US builder confidence in the market for newly built single-family homes improved slightly in July following the passage of US President Donald Trump’s fiscal bill, the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) reported on Thursday. 
Trump’s “[One Big Beautiful Bill Act](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/07/president-trumps-one-big-beautiful-bill-is-now-the-law/)” provided a number of important wins for households, home builders and small businesses, and therefore should spur housing momentum after a disappointing spring, said NAHB chairman Buddy Hughes. 
However, confidence remained low for a 15th consecutive month as elevated interest rates and economic and policy uncertainty continued to act as headwinds for the housing sector. 
Confidence, as measured by the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI), rose from 32 points in June to 33 in July. Readings below the 50-point neutral mark indicate builder pessimism, and above 50 they indicate optimism. 
The housing sector has weakened in 2025 due to poor affordability conditions, particularly from elevated interest rates, Hughes said. 
NAHB expects single-family [housing starts](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00111111722) to decline in 2025 due to the ongoing housing affordability challenges. 
**JULY HMI SURVEY** : 
  * The HMI index gauging current sales conditions rose one point in July to a level of 36. 
  * The gauge for sales expectations in the next six months increased three points to 43. 
  * The gauge charting traffic of prospective buyers posted a one-point decline to 20, the lowest reading since end of 2022. 


**REGIONAL HMI SCORES** : 
  * The Northeast increased two points to 45. 
  * The Midwest held steady at 41. 
  * The South dropped three points to 30. 
  * The West fell three points to 25. 


The housing market is a key consumer of chemicals, driving demand for a wide variety of chemicals, resins and derivative products, such as plastic pipe, insulation, paints and coatings, adhesives and synthetic fibers, among many other materials.

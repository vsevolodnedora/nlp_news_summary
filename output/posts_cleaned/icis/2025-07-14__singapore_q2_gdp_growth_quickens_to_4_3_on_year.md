SINGAPORE (ICIS)–Singapore’s economy expanded by 4.3% year on year in Q2 2025, accelerating from the 4.1% expansion in Q1, but significant global economic uncertainty persists in the second half, driven by unclear US tariff policies, official preliminary data showed on Monday. 
On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted basis, Singapore’s GDP expanded by 1.4% in the second quarter, reversing the 0.5% contraction Q1 2025, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said in a statement. 
For the first half of 2025, the annual average GDP growth was 4.2%. Full-year 2024 growth was 4.4%. 
“There remain significant uncertainty and downside risks in the global economy in the second half of 2025 given the lack of clarity over the tariff policies of the US,” MTI said. 
Singapore’s manufacturing sector grew by 5.5% year on year in Q2 2025, faster than the 4.4% expansion in the previous quarter. 
“Growth was driven by output expansions across all clusters, except for the chemicals and general manufacturing clusters,” the MTI added. 
The MTI in April this year lowered its GDP growth forecast for 2025 to 0-2%, from 1-3% previously, mainly due to the anticipated impact of US President Donald Trump’s tariff policies.

Singapore is a leading petrochemical manufacturer and exporter in southeast Asia, with more than 100 international chemical companies, including ExxonMobil and Aster Chemicals & Energy, based at its Jurong Island hub.

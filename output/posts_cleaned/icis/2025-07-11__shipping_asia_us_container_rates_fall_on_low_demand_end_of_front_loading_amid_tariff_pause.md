HOUSTON (ICIS)–Rates for shipping containers from east Asia and China to the US fell again this week as demand has fallen after a brief period of front loading during a pause in [tariffs](https://subscriber.icis.com/intelligence/1e18c969-8ff1-4928-892e-72d2b8af9230). 
With this week’s decreases, rates from Shanghai to Los Angeles have fallen by more than 50% over the past month, and rates from Shanghai to New York have fallen by more than 33% over the same time, as shown in the following chart from supply chain advisors Drewry.

Rates from China to the US West Coast have fallen faster than on other trade lanes because of the surge in shipping capacity once the Trump administration put a pause on extremely high tariffs on goods from China. 
But average spot rates from Asia to the US East Coast are [likely](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00111117968) to fall faster than rates to the West Coast and could be within $1,000/FEU (40-foot equivalent unit) by the end of July as carriers stop adding capacity to the transpacific trade lane. 
Average global rates continue to trend lower, falling by 5% week on week as shown in the following chart from Drewry.

Drewry expects spot rates to continue to decline next week as well due to excess capacity and weak demand. 
Rates from online freight shipping marketplace and platform provider Freightos also showed significant decreases to both US coasts. 
Rates to the West Coast are around $3,000/FEU (40-foot equivalent unit) while rates to the East Coast are around $5,000. 
Judah Levine, head of research at Freightos, said during a webinar this week that there remains a lot of uncertainty in ocean freight, especially since US President Donald Trump extended the tariff deadline to 1 August. 
“This three-week extension for reciprocal tariffs could mean that importers from those impacted countries will resume shipping activities that maybe they are already getting ready to pause if tariff hikes had materialized this week,” Levine said. “But this short run by only three weeks until August does not really make it possible to move goods from Asia in time.” 
Levine said that carriers canceled general rate increases (GRIs) for July and have mostly suspended or reduced peak season surcharges also aimed at July volumes. 
Levine said some carriers have already begun to remove capacity from the trade lane in efforts to stop the rate deterioration. 
Container ships and costs for shipping containers are relevant to the chemical industry because while most chemicals are liquids and are shipped in tankers, container ships transport polymers, such as polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP), are shipped in pellets. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is also shipped in containers. 
They also transport liquid chemicals in isotanks. 
**LIQUID TANKER RATES UNCHANGED**  
US chemical tanker freight rates assessed by ICIS were steady this week with rates holding steady despite continuing to face downward pressure on several trade lanes. 
There is a downward pressure on rates along the USG-Asia trade lane as charterers are still in wait-and-see mode. Besides contract cargoes, there is very little seen in the market. The tariffs and looming uncertainty continue to dampen the spot market, pressuring rates. 
The usual spot cargoes of methanol from Jose to China are the only ones reported, leaving methanol requirements from the region active to Asia. For the time being, larger parcels seem to have found a floor in the $60/tonne range. 
Similarly, rates from the USG to ARA and all other trade lanes also held steady. The previous uptick in activity which resulted from the recent Israel/Iran hostilities appears to have calmed and the market to Europe fell flat. As a result, this route remained quiet this week, which has placed downward pressure on freight rates. 
There have only been a few cargos fixed, a few more outsiders have come on berth and are working to fill space which has led to more competition for regular owners. MTBE, methanol and caustic soda are the most frequently reported in the market. 
From the USG to Brazil, this trade lane remains unusually quiet and in turn rates seem to have softened. Although availability for prompt space seems to be somewhat tight but there is plenty of open space for mid-July into August. 
The USG to India route has not seen an uptick in inquiries over the last week with no confirmed fixtures. There was only one new inquiry seen for 8,000-9,000 tonnes Pascagoula/Mumbai for August dates. Along with the other regions, freight rates are widely viewed as softer.

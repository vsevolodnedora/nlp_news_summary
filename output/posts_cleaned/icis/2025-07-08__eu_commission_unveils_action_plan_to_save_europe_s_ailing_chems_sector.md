LONDON (ICIS)–The European Commission has unveiled a plan to save the region’s ailing chemicals industry, while simplifying regulations to save €363 million a year, the institution announced on Tuesday. 
The Action Plan for the Chemicals Industry will tackle “high energy costs, unfair global competition and weak demand, while promoting investment in innovation and sustainability,” according to the statement. 
The Commission will form a Critical Chemical Alliance with member states and stakeholders “to address the risks of capacity closures in the sector.” Europe has already seen swathes of shutdowns this year against a backdrop of tough conditions. 
The Alliance will highlight critical production sites that need support, and will also address trade issues including supply-chain dependencies and distortions. 
In line with this, the Commission will apply defensive measures to ensure fair competition and expand chemical import monitoring through its existing Import Surveillance Task Force. 
The Alliance will align investment priorities, coordinate EU and national projects – including Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEIs) – and support innovation and growth at critical production sites. 
The Commission also said it will implement the Affordable Energy Action Plan “at full speed” to help reduce energy and feedstock costs for the chemicals industry. 
The plan introduces rules for low-carbon hydrogen and will update state aid to lower electricity costs for more chemical producers by the end of the year. The use of clean carbon sources – like carbon capture, biomass, and waste – are also encouraged in the plan, as well as support for renewables. 
There will be fiscal incentives and tax measures to help spur demand for clean chemicals, and the Industry Decarbonisation Accelerator Act will be introduced to support growth and investment in greener technologies. 
The upcoming Bioeconomy Strategy and Circular Economy Act will boost EU resource efficiency, chemicals recycling and “strengthen the market for bio-based and recycled alternatives to fossil-based inputs.” 
A public consultation has been launched on rules for calculating, verifying and reporting recycled content in single-use plastic (SUP) beverage bottles, which will be open until 19 August. 
Funding from Horizon Europe between 2025-2027 will be mobilized through the EU Innovation and Substitution Hubs to accelerate safer, more sustainable chemical substitutes. 
The Action Plan will reaffirm the Commission’s stance to minimize per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) emissions while be restricted. Continued use in critical applications where no alternatives are available “will be proposed swiftly after ECHA’s opinion,” the statement continued. 
“The Commission will also invest in innovation, promote remediation based on the polluter pays principle, and prioritise the development of safer alternatives.” 
The Commission is adopting its sixth simplification omnibus to reduce compliance and administrative costs for the chemicals industry, while still protecting human health and the environment. 
Annual savings of €363 million per year are expected through the ECHA Basic Regulation by simplifying hazardous chemical labelling, clarifying EU cosmetics regulations, and easing registration for EU fertilising products by aligning information with standard Reach requirements. 
The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) is now responsible for classification and labelling, biocidal products, import and export of hazardous chemicals, waste management and water. 
European chemicals industry body Cefic welcomed the plan saying it “marks an important and timely first step towards boosting the competitiveness and resilience of the EU chemical industry. 
“This crucial signal to global investors and the announced measures go beyond signalling support…[The plan] is a much-needed signal of support, following Cefic’s calls for action to protect Europe’s most strategic industries,” the statement read. 
“Now, we must act collectively and quickly to restore competitiveness and resilience. There is no strategic independence, no climate neutrality, no energy transition, and no clean tech transformation without the European chemical industry.”

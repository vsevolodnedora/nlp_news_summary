MADRID (ICIS)–Venezuelan authorities have reportedly withdrawn tax benefits for Brazilian products under a 2012 bilateral agreement, causing difficulties for exporters and potentially breaching zero-tariff arrangements between the neighboring countries. 
The Federation of Industries of the State of Roraima (Fier) has reported receiving complaints from businesspeople since 18 July about unexpected tariff charges on previously exempt Brazilian imports. 
“We receive information directly from business owners because we are responsible for issuing certificates of origin, which guarantee Brazilian products enter Venezuela with zero tariffs. But even with the certificate, the products are being subject to tariffs,” said Ivan Gonzalo, foreign trade analyst at Fier, quoted by Brazilian media outlet _Globo._
According to the same media outlet, Brazil’s foreign ministry – also called Itamaraty – said it has been monitoring reports in coordination with the Ministry of Development, Industry, Commerce and Services (MDIC). 
Fier, Itamaraty, the MDIC, the Venezuelan embassy in Brasilia, and the Venezuelan ministry of foreign relations had not responded to a request for comment at the time of writing. 
The Brazilian Embassy in Caracas is investigating with Venezuelan authorities to clarify the situation under Economic Complementarity Agreement No. 69 (ACE 69), which prohibits import taxes between the countries. 
Local media reported rates ranging from 15% to 77% on previously exempt products, though Fier could not confirm specific amounts. 
The uncertainty has prompted Brazilian companies to temporarily suspend shipments. 
Bilateral trade between Brazil and Venezuela has suffered ups and downs after the Venezuelan dictatorship plunged the country into crisis in the 2010s through mismanagement and widespread corruption. 
According to Itamaraty, trade rose in the 2000s and the early 2010s, reaching $6 billion in 2013, before Venezuela’s crisis hit hardest. 
“Between 2013 and 2019, it [trade] fell by almost 92%, dropping to $501 million. More recently, it has grown again, reaching $1.6 billion in 2024, and has become a major export destination for Brazil’s northern states, especially Roraima and Amazonas,” said the ministry. 
“In 2024, Brazil exported $1.2 billion to Venezuela and imported $422 million from the country. Sugars and molasses, vegetable fats and oils, and chemical fertilizers are the main products on the trade agenda.” 
However, local reports in Roraima said trade with Venezuela represents 46.1% of the state’s exports.

LONDON (ICIS)â€“Chinese wax producers may look at reviewing their selling strategies as the US-China have yet to announce a long-term deal ahead of the 12 August deadline. The Chinese CIF (cost, insurance and freight) paraffin wax spot prices have increased for four consecutive weeks as volume availability dropped. 
With no clear view on the negotiations between US and China, the upwards movements on Chinese wax prices may prove temporary. The shipping time for Chinese wax to reach the US is about a month, and considering the current agreement expires mid-August, any shipments starting their journey to the US late July face risks related to any political changes. 
A 90-day reduction in tariffs between the US and China encouraged sellers to shift their strategy. Immediately after the escalation of trade tariffs back in April, wax producers directed supplies into Europe to avoid the US import duties and lowered their prices to entice buyers. Since the US and China announced the trade truce as they negotiate a new trade deal, Chinese sellers have opted to shift volumes once again and send them to the US. 
This has so far led to a steady recovery in Chinese spot volumes offered in Europe given less availability in China. A flurry of Chinese wax volumes started to reach Europe in June, and the additional competition added some pressure on domestic spot prices for paraffin wax in recent weeks. But this was below expectations, because of refinery maintenance works in June and July in Poland and Hungary. 
Chinese CIF-origin wax volumes posted gains for the fourth consecutive week, rising $30/tonne to $1,270-1,340/tonne,

Sources expected a quiet demand period in August given the holiday season, with further price developments in September. Uncertainty may also drive some Chinese sellers to focus on Europe as a destination for their volumes. 
A stronger US dollar was also having an impact with buying appetite under pressure as the purchasing power of the euro was reducing. The currency has been highly volatile since the beginning of the year.

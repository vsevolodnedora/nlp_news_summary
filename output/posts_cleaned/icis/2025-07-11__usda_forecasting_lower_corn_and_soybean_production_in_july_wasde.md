HOUSTON (ICIS)â€“The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) said in the July World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimate (WASDE) report that the outlook for corn is for lower production and ending stocks, while soybeans will have slightly reduced production and exports but have increased ending stocks. 
For the corn crop beginning stocks are decreased by 25 million bushels to 1.3 billion bushels, which the agency said reflects an increase in exports that is partly offset by lower feed and residual use. 
Feed and residual use is down 75 million bushels based on indicated disappearance in the 30 June grain stocks report. Exports have been raised by 100 million bushels to 2.8 billion bushels based on current outstanding sales and shipments to date and, if realized, would be record high. 
Corn production is projected down by 115 million bushels on lower planted and harvested area from the 30 June acreage report. The yield is unchanged at 181 bushels per acre. 
Total use is cut 50 million bushels with a reduction for feed and residual use based on lower supplies, and with supply falling more than use, ending stocks are down 90 million bushels. 
The season-average farm price received by producers is unchanged at $4.20 per bushel. 
For soybeans, the July WASDE shows slightly lower production, reduced exports, and increased ending stocks compared to last month. 
Soybean production is projected at 4.3 billion bushels, down 5 million bushels from last month on lower harvested acres and an unchanged yield of 52.5 bushels per acre. 
Exports were lowered by 70 million bushels to 1.75 billion bushels on higher domestic demand, higher exports for Argentina and Ukraine, and larger Brazilian supplies at the end of September during the US peak export season. 
With lower soybean exports partly offset by higher crush, ending stocks are increased 15 million bushels to 310 million bushels. 
The US season-average soybean price is projected at $10.10 per bushel, down 15 cents from last month. 
The next WASDE report will be released on 12 August.

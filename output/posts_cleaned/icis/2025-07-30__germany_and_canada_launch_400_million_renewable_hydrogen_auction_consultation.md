LONDON (ICIS)–On 28 July the German Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWE) launched a public consultation for a €400 million bilateral renewable hydrogen auction with Canada. 
The auction, jointly funded by the German and Canadian governments with €200 million each, will support the import of renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBOs), including renewable hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, and other e-fuels, produced in Canada and sold to offtakers in Germany 
Unlike previous H2Global tenders, which relied on the intermediary Hintco to purchase hydrogen on long-term contracts with the aim of reselling those volumes at the highest possible price, this auction will directly match Canadian producers with German buyers for up-to 10-year offtake agreements. 
Hintco will facilitate the matchmaking but will not hold contractual obligations post-award. It will not guarantee delivery by producers or payment by offtakers. 
Like previous H2Global auctions, the difference between the winning producer’s price ask and the winning offtaker’s payment offer will be subsidised. 
BMWE has invited stakeholders to respond to a questionnaire outlining the auction design and eligibility criteria. 
The auction will allow bids based on energy content rather than fuel type. 
This flexibility is intended to maximise participation and cost-efficiency, with awards favouring suppliers offering the highest energy volumes. 
The consultation is open until 10 September.

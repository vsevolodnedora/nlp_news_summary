LONDON (ICIS)–Germany’s Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWE) has reaffirmed its commitment to accelerating the hydrogen economy, after a spate of recent industry setbacks including steel manufacturer ArcelorMittal’s cancellation of its renewable hydrogen-based decarbonisation plans for two steel plants. 
A spokesperson for the ministry told ICIS on 3 July that BMWE regrets ArcelorMittal’s cancellation but stressed that it was a private sector decision and that none of the €1.3 billion government subsidy secured for the project has been disbursed. 
They reiterated the ministry’s support for other major steel decarbonisation projects by Salzgitter, Thyssenkrupp, and SHS, which have collectively secured €5.6 billion in funding. 
“Reducing electricity prices in the short term is key for companies”, the spokesperson added, welcoming the European Commission’s recent adoption of the Clean Industrial Deal State Aid Framework, which provides the possibility to “reduce electricity prices for energy-intensive industries”. 
Since ArcelorMittal’s announcement, EWE, LEAG and E.ON have all confirmed to ICIS the postponement or cancellation of German projects totalling 80MW capacity of hydrogen production. 
However, the BMWE remains committed to the “swift implementation” of national and European regulations to enable the growth of the hydrogen industry. 
The spokesperson stated that “the development of a hydrogen economy is to be accelerated and organised more pragmatically”, using “all colours” of hydrogen, while transitioning to renewable hydrogen in the long-term. 
Hydrogen infrastructure expansion, including connections to all German and European ports, remains important. 
To improve the competitive conditions of the economy, the ministry wants to “abolish unnecessary bureaucracy (e.g. Supply Chain Act)” and “simplify planning and approval procedures”. 
The Supply Chain Act, which entered into force in 2023, requires companies to exercise due diligence to prevent or address human rights and environmental violations within their supply chains, but has been criticized for the administrative and cost burden on companies. 
The BMWE has recently made moves to simplify hydrogen bureaucracy. On 7 July, it published a draft bill for the hydrogen acceleration act, which aims to “significantly accelerate the market ramp-up of hydrogen (…) by establishing fast, simplified, and coordinated approval procedures with clear specifications and deadlines”. 
As part of the bill, hydrogen projects will be deemed to be of “overriding public interest”, which will give them priority in regulatory and legal balancing decisions. 
The spokesperson told ICIS that the status of the hydrogen ramp-up will be reviewed as a basis for further work addressing the country’s energy supply security.

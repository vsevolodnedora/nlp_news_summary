LONDON (ICIS)—“The founding fathers of the Energy Community and the Energy Community Treaty signed exactly 20 years ago proposed three objectives: competitiveness, security of supply and sustainability,” Energy Community director Artur Lorkowski [ told ICIS](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/energy/news-article-00111116743) in a recent podcast. 
“And those three are the principles that are being pursued until today,” Lorkowski concluded, adding that the principles are aligned with the integration new countries with the European Union. Accession negotiations are now pending for Ukraine, Moldova and Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
The purpose of the organisation established by the Energy Community Treaty in 2005 was to extend the EU internal energy market to southeastern Europe and beyond – with Georgia (2017), Ukraine (2011) and Moldova (2010) being the latest additions. This would be achieved by integrating non-EU countries into the bloc’s unified legal and regulatory energy framework. 
Twenty years ago, reforms in the EU energy sector indeed centered around increasing competition through liberalising member states’ gas and electricity markets. In the gas market, legal and ownership unbundling of gas supply and transport was one of the key topics. The main purpose of this was to allow competition, break up the grip of incumbent monopolies and diversify sources of supply. Many infrastructure projects in central and eastern Europe carried out with this goal in mind helped to negotiate the price of gas even with dominant suppliers – like Russia’s Gazprom at the time. 
For example, the [ Hungary-Slovakia interconnector](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/energy/news-article-00110217103) built in July 2015 stayed dormant for years although the first technical tests, flowing gas from Slovakia to Hungary at the Velke Zlievce border point, took place in February 2016. The lack of commercially viable transport tariffs and low liquidity on both hubs were cited as obstacles. Nevertheless, the pipeline did give Hungary more leverage in negotiations with Russia’s Gazprom by providing an alternative supply source, even on paper. 
However, while EU political and public figures may still be using the words “competition” and “security of supply” what stands behind them has become quite obscure in the past decade or so. 
On the political level the EU has been shifting towards ever-greater centralised power, extending even to attempts of joint gas purchasing through the [ AggregateEU platform](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/energy/news-article-00111031986). This goes hand in hand with expanding the European Commission’s influence through an ever greater and closer union. 
When it comes to the energy sector, climate goals and ensuing scores of regulation trumped any considerations of energy costs. 
As the Energy Community marks its milestone anniversary news headlines regarding the state of the European industry are bleak. 
On 8 July, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) producer Vynova announced the [ closure of its plant in Beek](https://www.vynova-group.com/press-releases/announcement-intention-vynova-beek), the Netherlands, by November 2025. 
The plant is closing due to a lack of competitiveness and the weak European market, according to CEO Christophe Andre. 
“The European PVC market is under strong pressure due to global overcapacity, persistently weak demand and increased competition from regions with lower production costs and less stringent regulations, he said, before adding, ‘These conditions are unlikely to improve in the near term.’ 
Only one day earlier, Dow announced the closure of three plants in Europe with the loss of 800 jobs – an ethylene cracker in Bohlen, Germany, chloralkali and vinyl assets in Schkopau, Germany and a siloxanes plant at Barry, UK. 
“This second closure announcement this week by Vynova Group follows [ Dow](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00111117141) on 7 July, highlighting the plight of Europe’s energy-intensive chemical sector,” said Will Beacham, deputy editor at ICIS Chemical Business. “Without EU protection and support we are in danger of hollowing out upstream chemical value chains and increasing vulnerability for the downstream industries they support. More than 5 million tonnes/year of ethylene capacity in Europe is now under threat of closure or other strategic moves, according to latest ICIS estimates.” 
Joining the European Union used to mean becoming part of a free and economically prosperous part of the world. This had special significance for people in eastern, southern and central Europe who had lived for decades under the oppression of the Soviet Union – a country based on a false ideology kept together through severe suppression of political freedoms and top-down control. 
On paper, being part of the Energy Community is still expected to improve its members’ economic status through application of laws and regulations that are supposed to foster competition thus improving security of supply. 
But the reality of the current state of EU industries stifled by endless regulation prompts the conclusion that the EU’s real goal is expanding its own ideology and spere of influence while paying lip service to concepts of freedom, competition and market economy.

LONDON (ICIS)–ICIS has received a written statement from the Directorate-General for the Environment (DG Env) confirming that under the _current_ scope of [Directive (EU) 2019/904](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019L0904) only recyclate made from post-consumer plastic waste placed on the EU market can count towards the 25% recycled content target set out in Directive 2019/904. 
ICIS contacted DG Env for clarification on the current scope of the SUPD and [Implementing Decision 2023/2683](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2023/2683/oj/eng) following publication of [a previous article in June](https://subscriber.icis.com/search/news/petchem/news-article-00111107708) in which ICIS stated that only recycled polyethylene terephthalate (R-PET) produced using plastic waste in the EU can currently count towards the 25% recycled content target set out under the Single Use Plastics Directive (SUPD) following written confirmation from DG Env. 
ICIS received comments from market participants following the June article expressing differing views to that stated by DG Env, leading to a follow-up request for additional clarification, specifically seeking confirmation if R-PET flakes and/or food-grade pellet imported from third countries outside of the EU can be used in the calculation of recycled content in PET beverage bottles placed on the EU market. 
In its reply to ICIS on 11 July, DG Env stated: 
“Article 6(5), point (a), of the SUP Directive requires Member States to ensure that as of 2025, SUP beverage bottles made of polyethylene terephthalate as the major component that are placed on their markets contain at least 25 % recycled plastic on average. 
The Commission laid down the rules on the calculation, verification and reporting on recycled content in SUP beverage bottles in Implementing Decision 2023/2683. 
  * Article 1(2) of this Implementing Decision defines ‘recycled plastic’ as “plastic which was **post-consumer plastic waste** before recycling as defined in Article 3(17) of Directive 2008/98/EC and which has been produced by recycling” [emphasis added]. 


  * Article 1(1) defines ‘post-consumer plastic waste’ as “waste, as defined in Article 3(1) of Directive 2008/98/EC, that is plastic and that has been generated from plastic products that have been **placed on the market** ” [emphasis added]. 


  * SUP Directive Art 3(6) defines ‘placing on the market’ as “the first making available of a product on the market **of a Member State** ” [emphasis added]. 


From this it follows that plastic waste stemming from products that had been placed on the market of a third country does not qualify as ‘post-consumer plastic waste’, therefore recyclates being processed from such waste do not qualify as ‘recycled plastic’ pursuant to the above-mentioned definitions.” 
Market contacts had raised queries regarding the use of the phrase ‘R_imported’ in formula 4 of Annex 1 of Implementing Decision 2023/2683 on which ICIS sought additional clarification. 
To this DG Env stated: 
“Formula 4 of Annex I of Implementing Decision 2023/2683 serves to calculate the weight of recycled plastic that is used in the bottles that are placed on the market of a Member State. The term ‘R_imported’ has been included for completeness – together with the terms ‘R_in from other MS’, ‘R_out to other MS’ and ‘R_exported’ – to ensure that movements of bottles across the Member States’ borders can be taken into account. It is defined as the “weight of recycled plastic used in bottles that have been imported, i.e. moved into the Union from third countries, and placed on the market in the Member State”. As such, it covers recycled plastic in imported bottles, with the definition of ‘recycled plastic’ as cited above, i.e. recycled plastic stemming from plastic products that had been placed on the EU market, before – at some point, as products or as waste – they had been brought into a third country. 
Notably, formula 4 is a simple calculation formula to guide the Member States as to how to calculate the weight of the recycled content in SUP beverage bottles that they have to report to the Commission to show compliance with the recycled content targets. As explained above, it does not create any inconsistency with the definition of ‘recycled plastic’ in Implementing Decision 2023/2683.” 
**FUTURE CHANGES**  
However, the current definition of ‘post-consumer plastic waste’ is likely to change as the Commission is working on a new Implementing Decision that will replace 2023/2683. 
DG Env stated: “[W]e are working on a new Implementing Decision, which will replace Implementing Decision 2023/2683. 
Notably, the definition of ‘postconsumer plastic waste’ therein has been aligned with the definition in the new [Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:L_202500040), which does include waste stemming from products that had been placed on the market of a third country. Therefore, once the new Implementing Decision is adopted and enters into force, such waste will be allowed to count towards the recycled content targets in the SUP Directive. 
The draft Implementing Decision, which is available to review and comment via the [Have Your Say portal](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13467-Single-use-plastic-beverage-bottles-EU-rules-for-calculating-verifying-and-reporting-on-recycled-plastic-content_en) until 19 August 2025, in preamble 16 now reads as ‘Post-consumer plastic waste needs to be understood as waste generated from plastic products that have been placed on the market of a Member State or of a third country.’ 
This new draft version adds in the phrase ‘…of a Member State or of a third country’, which is not present in the [existing Implementing Decision](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2023/2683/oj/eng). 
This statement from DG Env gives clarity on what currently counts towards the SUPD target while confirming the draft Implementing Decision will allow for recycled plastic made from post-consumer waste placed on the market of a third country to be allowed to count towards the SUPD recycled content targets.

SINGAPORE (ICIS)–Click [here](https://www.icis.com/asian-chemical-connections/2025/07/harnessing-ai-to-overcome-demographic-headwinds/) to see the latest blog post on Asian Chemical Connections by John Richardson: Can AI rewrite the future for economies facing ageing populations such China, where ICIS analysis suggests its population could fall to just 373 million by the end of this century? 
The traditional view of declining birth rates leading to inevitable economic decline might be about to change. AI, particularly Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), has the potential to fundamentally shift this paradigm: 
  * **Runaway Innovation & Productivity: **AI acts as an “idea multiplier,” driving exponential breakthroughs across sectors like biotechnology, green energy, and even AI itself. If automation becomes widespread and highly efficient, economic output could depend more on energy and infrastructure, rather than simply human population size. 
  * **Abundance, Not Scarcity:** Imagine a future of widespread abundance. AI-run factories could make manufactured goods, digital entertainment, and even food (via AI-optimised agriculture) incredibly affordable, potentially near-free. This could alleviate resource scarcity issues that often fuel geopolitical tensions and inflation. 


However, this transformative potential comes with significant considerations. While the opportunities are immense, so are the risks, such as widespread white-collar job displacement and the potential for extreme inequality. 
Ultimately, **human agency is key**. We have the power to shape AI’s trajectory: 
  * **Redistribution Models:** We can implement smart economic models like Universal Basic Income (UBI) or public ownership of AI capital to ensure the vast new wealth generated by AI is widely shared, rather than concentrating in the hands of a few. 
  * **Strategic Investment:** Focused investment in human-complementary sectors (like healthcare or education) and reskilling initiatives can ensure well-paid human jobs persist alongside AI. 


This future isn’t predetermined. How we choose to develop and govern AI will define global prosperity. What are your thoughts on how we can best harness AI’s potential for a more equitable and abundant world?

HOUSTON (ICIS)–The US reached a trade deal with Indonesia, the nation’s president said on Tuesday. 
Under the agreement, the US will charge a tariff of 19% on imports from Indonesia, President Donald Trump said on social media. For transshipments from countries subject to higher rates, the US will impose the higher rate on top of the Indonesia rate. 
Indonesia will charge no tariffs on US imports, Trump said. Also, Indonesia will import $15 billion worth of US energy, $4.5 billion worth of US agricultural products and 50 jets from Boeing, a US aerospace company. Trump did not say if these were one-time purchases or annual purchases. 
The US did not specify when the agreement will take effect. 
The US had threatened to impose tariffs of 32% on Indonesia on 1 August had the two countries failed to reach a trade deal. 
Indonesia is a significant source of US imports of feedstock used to make oleochemicals, such as palm oil, palm kernel oil (PKO) and coconut oil as well as downstream fatty acids and fatty alcohols.

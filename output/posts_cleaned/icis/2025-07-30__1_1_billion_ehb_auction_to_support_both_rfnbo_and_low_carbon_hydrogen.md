LONDON (ICIS)–On 30 July the European Commission published draft terms for its third Innovation Fund hydrogen auction (IF25), outlining a €1.1 billion support package aimed at scaling up renewable and low-carbon hydrogen production across the European Economic Area (EEA). 
The auction, part of the European Hydrogen Bank (EHB) and scheduled for the fourth quarter 2025, expands eligibility to include both renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBO) and electrolytic low-carbon hydrogen. 
The IF25 auction will be split across three topics: 
  * Topic 1 (€400 million): Open to RFNBO and/or electrolytic low-carbon hydrogen projects 
  * Topic 2 (€400 million): Exclusively for RFNBO hydrogen 
  * Topic 3 (€200 million): RFNBO and/or electrolytic low-carbon hydrogen projects for supply of the maritime sector, with potential for an additional €100 million via EEA country contributions under the Auction-as-a-Service (AaaS) mechanism 


Projects will compete for fixed premium payments per kilogram of certified hydrogen produced, with support lasting up to 10 years. 
The ceiling price is set at €4/kg, and bids will be ranked solely on price. 
To qualify, projects must demonstrate credible plans for electricity sourcing, hydrogen offtake, electrolyser procurement, and permitting. 
A minimum electrolyzer capacity of 5MW is required, and only new production capacity is eligible. 
To secure domestic manufacturing capacity, the auction introduces origin requirements for electrolyzers. At least 75% of electrolyzer units must originate outside China, with further restrictions on key components. 
Low-carbon hydrogen production must achieve at least 70% greenhouse gas savings compared to fossil fuels. 
The IF25 auction continues the AaaS model, allowing member states to use national funds for projects that are not granted support from the EHB pot. Germany, Spain, Austria, and Lithuania have previously used this mechanism. 
Previous rounds were oversubscribed. The second auction received 61 bids, with 15 projects selected for a total of €992 million support. Bid prices ranged from €0.20-0.60/kg for general projects and €0.45-1.88/kg for maritime projects. 
The first round attracted 132 bids for seven selected projects, dropping to six after one chose not to continue, and total support of around €694 million. Bid prices were between €0.37-0.48/kg. 
Consultation on the draft terms is open until 14 September.

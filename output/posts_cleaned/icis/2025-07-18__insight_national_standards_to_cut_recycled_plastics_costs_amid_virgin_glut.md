HOUSTON (ICIS)–National US standards for recycled plastics would make it easier for companies to collect waste plastic, which would lower costs and make the material more competitive in a market oversupplied with virgin resin, the American Chemistry Council (ACC) said. 
The group has unveiled a three-point plan that it said will make it easier for companies to collect waste plastic that can then be converted into recycled plastic. In addition, it recently testified in a hearing held by the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee of the House of Representatives, the lower legislative chamber of the US Congress. 
**US NEEDS NATIONAL RECYCLING STANDARDS  
** While there is plenty of currently available recycled plastic, several brands and converters continue to struggle with material quality, premium cost and manufacturing adoption, some of which could be improved with a focus on waste plastic collection and recycling infrastructure. 
National standards would ensure that US households have access to recycling, the ACC said. Standards would provide clear definitions of recycled and recycling content. They would also expand and modernize the infrastructure needed to collect waste plastic. 
Waste plastic is the feedstock that companies process to make recycled plastic. If collection costs fall and the quality of recycled plastic feedstock improves, recycled plastics would have an easier time competing with virgin material. 
Lawmakers have taken some steps towards passing recycling policies. 
Last year, two bills which would provide funding for recycling infrastructure and collect data on recycling and composting. The [ Recycling Infrastructure and Accessibility Act (RIAA)](https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/e/3/e37a95a7-5c09-4f7d-84c9-e7071287a03c/B7A156F00F87944879B90E33DA3FDB4D.02-15-22-rural-recycling-bill-text.pdf) and the [ Recycling and Composting Accountability Act (RCAA)](https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/e/a/ea63dec1-f4ec-484e-9c82-c986666314e9/9798B6A16616DA7A3AE76A68EE72DB0D.rya22073.pdf) gathered broad based bipartisan support, but ultimately did not pass. 
Similarly, last year Congress introduced a bipartisan bill, Accelerating a Circular Economy for Plastics and Recycling Innovation Act. It would have required the nation’s environmental regulator to create national plastic recycling standards. It also set a 2030 goal for plastic packaging to contain at least 30% of recycled content. 
One of the bill’s sponsors is retiring, so a similar one would need to start from scratch, said Ross Eisenberg, president of America’s Plastic Makers at the ACC. He made his comments in an interview with ICIS. 
**THREAT OF MULTIPLE STATE REGULATIONS  
** If the US lacks national policies, states will adopt their own rules and create a patchwork of regulations that will increase compliance costs for companies. 
So far, seven have passed plastic packaging laws related to extended producer responsibility (EPR), 10 have passed bottle deposit laws and five have passed standalone laws that set minimum requirements for plastic post-consumer recycled (PCR) content. 
**NATIONAL STANDARDS FOR CHEMICAL RECYCLING  
** The US should adopt national standards for chemical recycling, which is also known as advanced recycling, the ACC said. 
Chemical recycling is an umbrella term for several different technologies that break down plastics at a molecular level. These various processes such as pyrolysis, dissolution and methanolysis have vastly different production and environmental outcomes. 
According to the ACC, chemical recycling needs to be designated as a manufacturing process to make it easier for companies to develop plants. 
Right now, such designations are being done on a state-by-state basis. So far, 25 states have passed policies which recognize chemical recycling as a manufacturing process rather than a waste management one. 
Companies are building chemical recycling plants in states that consider the technology a manufacturing process, Eisenberg said. 
Though redefining the process is not the only hurdle. Once the plants are built, companies still need assurance that their output would count towards mandates for PCR content and EPR regulations. 
**GLOBAL PLASTICS TREATY CAN SUPPORT US POLICIES  
** The global plastics treaty under negotiation could act as a starting point to introduce more policies in the US that would create market signals that would stimulate demand, Eisenberg said. 
If the global plastics treaty gets approved and it included provisions on recycled content and EPR, trade groups like the ACC could point to those provisions as an example that the US should follow. 
Policies about recycled content could create demand and generate market signals that would encourage companies to make investments to collect waste plastic and process it into recycled material, Eisenberg said. 
So far, the ACC has reached out to explain the importance of US involvement in the treaty discussions with the new administration of US President Donald Trump, Eisenberg said. 
“We’re really encouraged by what we are seeing out of them,” he said. 
The US has sent representatives to most of the lead-ups to the pre-meetings of the treaty negotiations, and Eisenberg expects that they will send some form of delegation to the next round of talks. 
The next UN meeting on the treaty (INC 5.2) is expected be held 5-14 August 2025 in Geneva, Switzerland. 
The US position aligns with the ACC’s, which wants the treaty to focus on ending plastic pollution and not on banning plastic, [ according to a report by Climate Home News](https://www.climatechangenews.com/2025/07/04/us-comes-out-against-plastic-production-limits-in-un-treaty-at-deadlocked-talks/#:~:text=The%20US%20government%20is%20pushing,upcoming%20final%20round%20of%20negotiations.).

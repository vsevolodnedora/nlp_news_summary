HOUSTON (ICIS)â€“The US has proposed on Monday tariffs of 25% on imports from Japan as well as from South Korea, which was the top source of US imports of aromatics and base oils in 2024. 
The tariffs will take effect on 1 August, US President Donald Trump said on social media. The tariffs would not apply to imports subject to the sectoral tariffs that the US has adopted on goods such as aluminium, steel and automobiles. 
The US will also start imposing an unspecified higher tariff on transhipped goods from Japan and South Korea. The US is already adopting such a tariff on transhipped goods from Vietnam, which it set at 40%. 
**S KOREA IS TOP US SOURCE OF IMPORTED AROMATICS  
** South Korea is the largest source of US imports of benzene, toluene and mixed xylenes (MX), according to ICIS. In addition, it is the second largest source of paraxylene (PX), trailing only Mexico. 
These are building block chemicals produced as byproducts from refineries or from cracking naphtha, an oil-based feedstock. Companies will not purposely expand refineries or naphtha crackers to produce these byproducts. As a result, US importers will have to find lower-cost sources, pay the tariffs or lower production. 
Benzene is used to make many intermediates such as cumene and styrene. 
Cumene is used to make phenol and acetone, which, in turn, are feedstock for polycarbonate (PC) and methyl methacrylate (MMA) respectively. 
Styrene is used to make polystyrene (PS), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) among many others. 
Toluene and MX can be used as solvents or octane boosters for gasoline. MX can be further refined to produce orthoxylene (OX) and PX. 
PX is one of the two main feedstocks used to make polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a polyester used to make fabric and beverage bottles.

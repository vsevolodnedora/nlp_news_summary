MADRID (ICIS)–Brazilian chemical producers are facing several contract cancellations as US President Donald Trump threatens fresh 50% levies on Latin America’s largest economy from 1 August, trade group Abiquim said. 
In a written response to ICIS, Abiquim’s director general Andre Passos said the window to reach a trade deal with the US is closing, prompting the orders cancellations. 
“These decisions are being made because the bet is that Trump will actually apply the tariff,” said Passos. 
Abiquim, which represents chemical producers in Brazil, said following [ Trump’s tariffs announcement](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00111118035) earlier in July, export orders have been canceled for specific resins and compounds utilized in fertilizers production. 
While Brazil is a net importer of fertilizers to feed its powerful agricultural sector, the country also exports certain fertilizers to the US’s agricultural sector, said Abiquim. 
Brazilian chemicals exports to the US stood at $2.4 billion in 2024. 
According to Passos, one Brazilian company had seen all its US export contracts canceled, while others have reported partial cancellations for certain shipments or products. 
He added that there have also been cases of sellers that experienced cancellations for previously greenlit export financing and the order linked to that financing. 
However, he did not mention the affected exporters. 
On 29 July, US chemicals producer Olin said the possibility that Brazil could impose retaliatory tariffs on US imports has already caused a [ decline in US caustic soda shipments](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00111123410) to Latin America as a whole. 
“What we’re seeing is less material being exported to Latin America just because of the threat of the tariffs that are there. That’s causing some headwind in the cost at the market in the short term,” said Olin CEO Ken Lane. 
**WIDESPREAD IMPACT  
** According to Passos, the damage associated with the US tariffs could extend beyond direct chemicals shipments because virtually every industry employs chemicals in manufacturing processes. 
“No-one produces coffee, even grains, without some kind of chemical product in the process. Brazilian plywood exporters, for instance, utilize chemicals for bonding, and they are also facing US order cancellations,” said Passos. 
“Orange juice manufacturers, which dispatched 42% of their exports to the US last year, also employ chemical preservatives.” 
Abiquim [ reiterated its stance](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00111118195) that US tariffs on Brazilian chemicals “lack justification”, given the sector’s trade deficit with the US, which in 2024 stood at $7.9 billion: the result of Brazil importing $10.4 billion worth of chemicals while exports were valued at $2.4 billion. 
**CONTINGENCY PLANS  
** While [ analysts said](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00111120816) in mid-July that a deal between the US and Brazil before 1 August was within reach, hopes are fading less than 48 hours before the tariffs’ effective date. 
Brazilian Foreign Minister Mauro Viera reportedly attempted to reach the US administration to negotiate a potential deal while attending a summit in New York earlier this week, without success. 
This week, Brazil’s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva received a contingency plan from finance minister Fernando Haddad aimed at assisting companies affected by the 50% tariff, according to state-owned news agency _Agencia Brasil._
Haddad said, however, that Brazil does not intend to abandon negotiations and will continue prioritizing dialogue to reverse the measure. 
“The possible scenarios are already known to the president. We have not yet made any decision [on potential retaliation], because we do not even know what the US’s decision will be on 1 August,” said Haddad, without giving details about the contingency plan. 
“The important thing is that the president now holds in his hands all the scenarios that have been defined by four ministries. We agreed to present him [Lula] with the contingency plan, including all the options available to Brazil and to him as president. [But] the focus remains on negotiations,” he added.

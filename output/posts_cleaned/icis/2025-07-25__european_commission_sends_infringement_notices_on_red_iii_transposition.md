LONDON (ICIS)–On 24 July 2025, the European Commission sent letters of formal notice to 26 member states for failing to transpose key provisions of the revised Renewable Energy Directive (RED III) by the 21 May 2025 deadline. Only Denmark is considered to have fully transposed these provisions so did not receive a letter. 
The formal notices cover all RED III measures that were due in May 2025, including the renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBO) targets for industry under Articles 22a and 22b, and for road and maritime transport under Article 25. They also address guarantees of origin, system integration requirements, and sustainability safeguards. 
Under EU infringement rules, the 26 EU countries will now have two months to submit full transposition measures. If the commission deems the replies unsatisfactory, reasoned opinions will be issued. Further non-compliance could lead to the cases being referred to the European Court of Justice, where financial penalties may be imposed. 
  1. Article 22a requires member states to set binding national targets for RFNBOs in industry, specifying the share of renewable hydrogen, synthetic fuels and other carbon-neutral carriers each sector must achieve by 2030 
  2. Article 22b establishes common sustainability and greenhouse gas emission criteria, requiring certification schemes that enforce feedstock traceability, lifecycle emissions calculations and independent verification 
  3. Article 25 obliges Member States to ensure a minimum share of renewable and low-carbon fuels in road transport and maritime shipping, with sub-quotas for advanced biofuels, renewable hydrogen and synthetic e-fuels 


This development follows the commission’s decision to issue reasoned opinions to Ireland, Latvia, and Portugal for failing to transpose Article 15a of RED III, one year after the 1 July 2024 deadline. 
Article 15a requires each member state to set clear time limits for processing renewable energy permits, to establish designated areas where permitting rules apply, and to create single points of contact for developers. It also calls for user-friendly digital tools and transparent online procedures to streamline permitting procedures.

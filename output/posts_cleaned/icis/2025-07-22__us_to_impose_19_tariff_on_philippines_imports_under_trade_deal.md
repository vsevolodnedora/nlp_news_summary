HOUSTON (ICIS)–The US and the Philippines reached a trade deal, under which the US will impose 19% tariffs on imports from the island nation, while its shipments will enter the country duty free, President Donald Trump said on Tuesday. 
“In addition, we will work together Militarily,” Trump said on social media. 
No reports of any trade deal were found on websites of the [Philippine Information Agency](https://pia.gov.ph/news/) or the [Philippine News Agency](https://www.pna.gov.ph/). 
The rate disclosed by the US is 1 point below the 20% rate that Trump proposed in a letter he sent to the Philippines. 
Chemical trade between the two countries is relatively small. The Philippines exports mostly polyethylene terephthalate (PET) to the US and imports polyethylene (PE), base oils and acrylate esters, according to the ICIS Supply and Demand Database. 
The Philippines is the largest source of US imports of coconut oil, a feedstock used to make oleochemicals. 
The following table shows 2024 US imports from the Philippines and exports to the Philippines. Figures are in US dollars. 
**Imports for Consumption ($)** |  **Domestic Exports ($)** |  **US Deficit ($)**  
---|---|---

The Philippines is the fourth country with which the US said it reached a trade deal, following agreements struck with the UK, Vietnam and Indonesia. 
The US said its imports will enter Vietnam and Indonesia tariff free. It will impose tariffs of 19% on Indonesian imports and 20% tariffs on Vietnamese imports. 
For UK imports, the US will impose 10% tariffs. The UK made concessions on US imports of ethanol and beef. 
**NEGOTIATIONS ONGOING FOR NUMEROUS COUNTRIES  
** In July, the US proposed tariffs on imports from the EU and 24 countries. The proposed rates will take effect on 1 August if the countries cannot reach a trade agreement or if the US does not postpone the duties. 
The following table shows the proposed rates and the actual rates for any countries with which the US said it reached trade agreements.

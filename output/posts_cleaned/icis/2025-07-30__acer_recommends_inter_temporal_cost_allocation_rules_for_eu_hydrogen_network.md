LONDON (ICIS)–On 28 July, the EU’s Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) issued its first formal guidance on how hydrogen network costs should be shared between early and future users, recommending an inter-temporal cost allocation (ITCA) framework. 
ITCA is a mechanism that allows hydrogen network investors to recover infrastructure costs over time through tariffs. 
The aim is to avoid burdening early users with high costs while the market is still nascent. 
Germany’s WANDA scheme is the only operational ITCA model in the EU, though Denmark is developing a similar scheme. 
In Germany initial revenue shortfalls, due to low early demand and high upfront infrastructure costs, are recorded in an €24 billion amortisation account, financed by a loan from the country’s state-owned investment bank. 
Pipeline operators must repay this fund by 2055, or cover 24% of any shortfall, with the state absorbing the rest. 
In May, Dutch regulators cited the mechanism as a method to prevent soaring transmission costs in the Netherlands. 
Hydrogen is a key part of the EU’s decarbonisation strategy, but infrastructure investment has not developed as quickly as once expected. 
High production costs and the uncertain pace of demand materialisation has made it difficult for hydrogen projects to secure private capital. 
Without mechanisms like ITCA, ACER argues that early-stage tariffs could become prohibitively expensive, deterring uptake. 
EU-wide network codes for hydrogen are not expected before 2027, leaving member states to design interim rules.

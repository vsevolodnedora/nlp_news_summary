LONDON (ICIS)–Europe’s oxo-alcohols and derivatives markets remain structurally weak, with some players beginning to feel the onset of the summer slowdown. 
Ongoing economic weakness and geopolitical uncertainty continue to dampen sentiment, with activity expected to slow further from late July into August as summer holidays begin. 
Oxo-alcohols and their derivative markets are not expected to experience significant demand changes in H2 2025. 
Oxo-alcohols and butyl acetate reporter, Marion Boakye, joins acrylate esters editor, Mathew Jolin-Beech, and glycol ethers editor, Cameron Birch, to discuss current conditions along the oxo-alcohols value chain.

BARCELONA (ICIS)–The permanent closure of SABIC’s cracker and other facilities at Wilton, UK, shows how tough conditions are in Europe with recyclers also feeling the pinch. 
  * Closure of UK polymer recycling facilities has been a shock to the industry 
  * European recyclers find it hard to compete against imports, more support for local recycling needed 
  * Regulations are helping recycling sector, but more action needed 
  * Outlook for Europe recycling more positive than for base chemicals 
  * Chemical plant closures remove good quality jobs which are tough to replace 
  * Wilton, UK site is perfect for development of circular economy 
  * EU-US 15% tariff deal removes threat of 30% but many questions remain

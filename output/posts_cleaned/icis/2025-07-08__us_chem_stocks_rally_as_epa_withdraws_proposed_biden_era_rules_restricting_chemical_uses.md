The withdrawn proposed rule, a significant new use rule (SNUR) under the TSCA, would have required businesses that intended to manufacture or import any of 18 specific chemical substances derived from plastic waste to notify the EPA at least 90 days prior to beginning any activity. 
New uses under the SNUR included manufacturing, processing, use, distribution in commerce, or disposal that do not conform to restrictions imposed from other TSCA requirements. 
Also, another proposed SNUR targeted manufacturing or processing of chemical substances using feedstocks containing any amount of heavy metals (chromium, cadmium, chromium VI, lead, or mercury), dioxins, phthalates, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and benzophenone, bisphenol A, ethyl glycol and methyl glycol. 
During its recent annual meeting in Colorado Springs, Colorado, the America Chemistry Council (ACC), a trade group that represents chemical companies, said it was [optimistic](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00111107420) that EPA regulatory shifts could emerge under the Trump Administration. 
The ACC also [submitted](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00111108151) to the EPA a list of more than 30 regulations it felt the agency could examine. 
**TRUMP COULD ASSESS 50% COPPER TARIFFS**  
Trump, speaking to assembled media at the White House during a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, said that he was planning on announcing a 50% tariff on copper imports later in the day. 
“Today we are doing copper,” Trump said. “I believe we are going to make it 50%.” 
The Wall Street Journal, citing Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, said the copper tariffs will take effect on 1 August. 
US copper futures prices for September delivery jumped by 12% after the announcement and were up about 10% when markets closed.

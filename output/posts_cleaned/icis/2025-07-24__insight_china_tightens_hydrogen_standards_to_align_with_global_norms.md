SINGAPORE (ICIS)–China has proposed new industry standards for low-carbon, clean and renewable hydrogen, introducing stricter carbon thresholds that align renewable hydrogen with international benchmarks, particularly those of the EU. 
  * China tightens hydrogen carbon limits and introduces a formal life cycle accounting method to guide industry compliance and emissions tracking 
  * New rules align with international standards, paving way for future long-term export compatibility 
  * Standard supports a multi-pathway model to back both fossil and renewable hydrogen 


The draft 2025 “Clean and Low-Carbon Hydrogen Evaluation Standard” also preserves a multi-pathway development model that supports diverse hydrogen production routes, and hence could accelerate domestic hydrogen industry growth, reflect the nation’s “establish-before-break” approach to energy transition, as well as enhance future export readiness. 
The standard, overseen by the China Electricity Council and led by Guoneng HydrogenTech, aims to be finalized by August 2025. It marks a shift from the 2020 group-led T/CAB0078—2020 to a government-backed industrial standard under the National Energy Administration (NEA). The upgrade strengthens China’s regulatory foundation to prepare for future international certification and trade. 
The 2025 revision introduces stricter carbon intensity caps: 
The 2025 standard also defines, for the first time, a clear methodology for calculating carbon intensity thresholds. 
The baseline carbon intensity of hydrogen production in 2020, the year when China first proposed its “dual carbon” goal, was calculated at 17.704 kgCO2e/kgH2, _(_ kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilogram of hydrogen) weighted across coal-based, natural gas-based, and industrial by-product hydrogen. 
  * **Coal-based hydrogen** : Set at 24 kgCO2e/kgH2, based on International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates and empirical data from six major domestic projects including those from China Energy and Sinopec, averaging 23.4 kgCO2e/kgH2. The figure reflects the dominant method in China and is considered broadly representative. 
  * **Natural gas hydrogen** : Benchmarked at 11.45 kgCO2e/kgH2, in line with IEA’s Opportunities for Hydrogen Production with carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) in China report. A domestic survey of 21 projects showed a broader range (7–17 kg kgCO2e/kgH2, hence averaging 12 kgCO2e/kgH2), but the IEA average was adopted for consistency and stability. 
  * **Industrial by-product hydrogen** : Established at 2.88 kgCO2e/kgH2, based on data from 37 projects across the five key hydrogen fuel cell vehicle demonstration clusters in China: Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Shanghai, Guangdong, Zhengzhou, and Hebei. Sources include coke oven gas, chlor-alkali, steam cracking, propane dehydrogenation, coal tar upgrading, styrene production, and others. Weighted averages were calculated by production volume. 


Using the emission reduction forecasts by China Energy Investment Corp in its “China Energy Outlook 2060”, the standard sets carbon targets for clean and low-carbon hydrogen reflecting projected improvements by 2040 and 2060. 
Renewable hydrogen’s threshold is derived from measured emissions during electrolysis and compression, plus grid electricity-related emissions. 
China has established detailed methodologies for calculating hydrogen’s carbon footprint using a full life cycle assessment (LCA) approach, or a cradle-to-gate scope, which aligns with global practices in carbon accounting. 
The 2025 draft hydrogen standard defines the carbon footprint of hydrogen (CFPH2) as the sum of greenhouse gas emissions from four stages—raw material extraction, transportation, production, and on-site storage—minus any carbon dioxide captured and permanently stored via carbon capture and storage (CCS). 
The calculation is expressed as: 
**CFP****ₕ****₂ = (E_raw + E_trans + E_prod + E_sto** **– R_CCS)** **× A_H2 / Q_H2**
Where: 
  * **CFP****H2** is the carbon footprint of hydrogen (kg CO2e per kg H2) 
  * **E_raw** = emissions from raw material acquisition (t CO2e) 
  * **E_trans** = emissions from material transport (t CO2e) 
  * **E_prod** = emissions during hydrogen production (t CO2e) 
  * **E_sto** = emissions from on-site storage and handling (t CO2e) 
  * **R_CCS** = CO₂ captured and permanently stored (t CO2) 
  * **A_H2** = allocation factor for hydrogen relative to co-products (%) 
  * **Q_H2** = quantity of hydrogen produced (t) 


**THREE-TIER SYSTEM SUPPORTS INDUSTRIAL SCALING**  
This 2025 standard codifies a three-tier system – low-carbon, clean, and renewable hydrogen – designed to accommodate diverse production methods, including fossil fuels-based production with CCUS. This approach supports industrial scaling while avoiding early bottlenecks, consistent with the government’s build-before-phase out strategy for new energy like hydrogen. 
The EU’s latest regulatory move underscores the relevance of China’s strategy. In July 2025, the European Commission published the methodology for defining low-carbon hydrogen, requiring a 70% reduction in greenhouse gases compared with unabated fossil fuels. 
The regulated act complements existing RFNBO (Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin) protocols and applies to both domestic production and importsand recognizes CCUS-based fossil fuels as eligible production pathways of low-carbon hydrogen. 
**EXPORT READINESS LIMITED DESPITE ALIGNMENT IN STANDARD**  
China’s new draft renewable hydrogen threshold (≤2.00 kgCO2e/kgH2) is among the world’s most stringent. 
Combined with estimated emissions from domestic transportation and for deliveries to Europe, the total carbon footprint remains under the EU’s RFNBO limit. 
For renewable hydrogen, inputs must come exclusively from non-fossil sources powered by renewable electricity, echoing EU requirements for RFNBOs. Clean and low-carbon hydrogen have no such restrictions on feedstock type or energy source. 
China’s stricter hydrogen rules bring it closer to global standards, but the country’s export readiness remains limited in the immediate years. 
Renewable hydrogen makes up merely 2% of national output at present, with coal continuing to dominate.. 
In addition to scaling up hydrogen production, large-scale exports will require robust export logistics and infrastructure, technical validation, trusted certification systems, mutual recognition of certification mechanisms such as Guarantees of Origin and third-party voluntary schemes, and stronger emissions tracking across the supply chain — all of which remain underdeveloped. 
The new standard in China lays the groundwork for future alignment with EU rules and long-term access to the global markets.

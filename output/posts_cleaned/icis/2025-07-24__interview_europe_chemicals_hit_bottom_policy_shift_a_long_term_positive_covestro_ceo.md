WASHINGTON, DC (ICIS)–The European chemical industry has hit bottom and there are positive developments for structural reforms that could lead to a brighter future, said the CEO of Germany-based Covestro. 
“First, we see clear signs that the negative growth trajectory for the European chemical industry has come to an end. It has significantly slowed down, and from my perspective, now has come to an end, so we’ve hit the bottom,” said Markus Steilemann, CEO of Covestro, in an interview with ICIS. 
Steilemann spoke to ICIS at the headquarters of the American Chemistry Council (ACC) in Washington, D.C. 
“The key question is now, what type of structural reforms will come? I’ve seen significant movements in terms of the willingness to look at overall regulation, but also the energy price situation in Europe, because that is the starting point to reinstall consumer confidence,” he added. 
**‘IT’S THE ECONOMY, STUPID’  
** A renewed focus on the economy and its key drivers by the EU and Germany could provide support for the chemical industry in the form of deregulation, energy initiatives and tax benefits, he noted, recalling the defining theme of former US President Bill Clinton’s first election campaign in 1992 – “[It’s the economy, stupid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_the_economy,_stupid)”. 
“That fundamental principle – that the economy at the end of the day is the provider of wealth, of societal coherence, of the ability to defend, and so on and so forth – is sinking in,” said Steilemann. 
“Energy, regulations, taxes and innovation as the four key drivers in that context, has from my perspective been finally understood, and we can see first small steps in the right direction,” he added. 
The CEO now sees a “strong willingness” by the EU and Germany to address the high cost of energy and dampen some of the effects from the halt in importing Russian gas following the Russia-Ukraine war. 
As part of its €46 billion tax reduction package passed in July, Germany reduced energy taxes for large manufacturers and certain other groups from 1.54 cents/kilowatt hour (kWh) to the EU minimum of €0.05/kWh. 
**SMALL STEPS IN DEREGULATION  
** On the regulatory front, the industry is seeing “first small steps towards not executing some… reporting requirements, and at the same time, also prolonging exemptions for small and mid-sized entities, which have been hit very hard by those additional reporting needs,” said Steilemann. 
Excessive bureaucracy costs Germany up to €146 billion/year in lost economic output, according to a [ study by the ifo Institute](https://www.ifo.de/en/press-release/2024-11-14/bureaucracy-germany-costs-146-billion-euros-year-lost-economic-output) released in November 2024. 
“If you just deduct this, you can imagine how big the size of the prize is, if the German and EU governments do something about regulation specifically,” said Steilemann. 
“It’s not only rolling back but really withdrawing some of those regulations. There have been small steps, but these could also be the first steps of a long journey,” he added. 
**FUTURE IN SPECIALTIES  
** Highly energy intensive and large raw material dependent chemical investments are difficult to justify in Europe, but specialty chemicals are the future, the CEO pointed out. 
“We must not forget that for Germany alone, of the more than 2,000 companies we have as members of the German Chemical Industry Association (VCI), more than 90% are small to mid-sized entities (SMEs),” said Steilemann, who is also president of VCI. 
“It’s not the big corporations that make the biggest part of the chemical industry. [It’s the SMEs that] make specialties. They are highly innovative and their investment is going into Germany because they have no internationalization strategy,” he added. 
The EU and Germany governments are starting to understand and address the situation for energy costs, labor productivity and regulations. 
“That’s why I see with structural changes in the Europe and Germany, a very bright future, given the fact that Germany has always been strong in innovation, and that there’s a broad base of small and mid-sized entities that can carry that growth,” said Steilemann. 
Energy-intensive chemicals represent around 10% of the entire chemical sector in Germany, with the majority already taken out or in prolonged shutdowns, he added. 
Covestro and LyondellBasell in March 2025 announced the [ permanent shutdown](https://www.covestro.com/press/lyondellbasell-and-covestro-announce-permanent-closure-of-po11-unit-at-maasvlakte-netherlands/) of their joint venture propylene oxide/styrene monomer (POSM) plant in Maasvlakte, Netherlands by the end of 2026. 
“We are reviewing constantly our asset footprint, but we currently don’t have any active plans [for further shutdowns],” said Steilemann.

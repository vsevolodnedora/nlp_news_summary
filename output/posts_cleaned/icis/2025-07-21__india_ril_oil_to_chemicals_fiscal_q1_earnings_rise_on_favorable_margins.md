SINGAPORE (ICIS)–India’s Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) on 18 July reported a 10.8% year-on-year increase in its oil-to-chemicals (O2C) earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) amid favorable margins on domestic fuel retail and downstream chemical deltas. 
**in crore Indian rupee (Rp10,000,000)** |  **Apr-Jun 2025 (Q1 FY2026)** |  **Apr-Jun 2024** |  **% Change**  
---|---|---|---  
Revenue  |  154,804  |  157,133  |  -1.5   
Exports  |  59,245  |  71,463  |  -17.1   
EBITDA  |  14,511  |  13,093  |  10.8   
Revenue fell 1.5% year on year in the fiscal first quarter ended 30 June amid falling crude oil prices and lower volumes, the latter due to planned shutdowns, the Indian chemicals major said in a statement. 
RILS’ O2C EBITDA margin grew 9.4% in April-June this year from 8.3% in the same period a year earlier. 
Earnings for the period were offset by “lower volumes due to planned turnaround, and decline in polyester chain margins”. 
Domestic polymer demand rose by 2% year on year in Q1 FY26, with polypropylene (PP) demand up by 7%, led by packaging, furniture, and automotives, polyethylene (PE) demand decreasing by 1% amid lower demand from the infrastructure sector, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) demand remaining stable year on year despite the early arrival of the monsoon season. 
Domestic polyester demand grew by 3% over the same period, with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) demand down 10%, due to lower demand from beverages sector amid the early monsoon onset. Polyester filament yarn (PFY) demand increased by 9%, and polyester stable fiber (PSF) demand by 3%, both amid improved downstream operations. 
**POLYMER MARGINS SHOW MIXED TRENDS  
** Polymer margins showed varied trends in Q1 FY26, with PP margins jumping by 13% and PVC margins up by 4%, while PE margins were lower, falling by 1% year on year. 
The price of ethylene dichloride (EDC) was at $184/tonne, down 42% year on year with increased availability due to strong caustic prices, while Singapore naphtha price was lower by 14% at $561/tonne. 
PP margin over naphtha improved to $360/tonne from $318/tonne in the same period a year ago on lower feedstock prices, whereas PE margin over naphtha declined to $325/tonne from $330/tonne in the same period last year as higher supplies pressured product prices. 
PVC margin over EDC and naphtha rose to $385/tonne from $371, primarily led by a sharp decline in EDC prices. 
Meanwhile, the polyester chain margin decreased to $446/tonne from $489 in Q4 FY24, driven by a significant 34% drop in PX margin over naphtha due to a sharp increase in PX supplies.

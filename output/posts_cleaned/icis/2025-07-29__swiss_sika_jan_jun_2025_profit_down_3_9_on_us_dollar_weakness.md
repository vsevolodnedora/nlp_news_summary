SINGAPORE (ICIS)–Sika’s January-June 2025 profit decreased by 3.9% year on year amid a weaker US dollar, despite a sales increase in local currencies, the Switzerland-based international construction chemicals major said on Tuesday. 
**in Swfr (million)** |  **Jan-Jun 2025** |  **Jan-Jun 2024** |  **% change**  
---|---|---|---  
Sales  |  5,676.4  |  5,834.8  |  –2.7   
EBITDA  |  1,070.4  |  1,092.9  |  –2.1   
Operating profit  |  798.1  |  822.2  |  –2.9   
Profit after taxes  |  554.4  |  577.1  |  –3.9   
Globally, Sika grew by 1.6% in local currencies for the first half of 2025, with 0.6% attributed to organic growth and 1.0% to acquisition effect. 
A weaker US dollar was predominantly responsible for high foreign currency impact, causing a foreign exchange loss of 4.3%, Sika said. 
Meanwhile, Sika acquired four companies – in Singapore, the UK, North America and Qatar – and commissioned seven new plants in 2025, including in Singapore, China and [ Ecuador](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00111089856). 
Economic conditions improved slightly across Europe in the first half of 2025, and the construction industry in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA region) is expected to grow 1.3% in 2025, Sika said. 
Sales in EMEA region increased by 1.9% in local currencies, down from 13.5% in the same period last year, with strong growth recorded in the Middle East and Africa. 
In the Americas, Sika achieved a 3.5% increase in sales in local currencies, down from 15.1% in the previous year, amid market uncertainty wrought by “mixed signals regarding US trade policy”, the company said. 
In the Asia/Pacific region, sales declined by 1.7% in local currencies, compared with 8% growth in the same period last year. 
Significant challenges in the Chinese residential market persisted despite government support initiatives. 
Among southeast Asian countries, Vietnam and Indonesia showed strong growth due to public spending, and overall, the region displayed sluggishness in the real estate market. For Automotive, southeast Asia and India recorded double-digit growth. 
In January, Sika opened a plant in both Singapore and Xi’an, which is located in northwest China. 
“The newly built plant in Singapore specializes in the production of mortars, while the Xi’an facility manufactures a full range of products, including tile adhesives, cementitious waterproofing, and flooring solutions,” Sika said. 
For business year 2025, Sika aims for an EBITDA margin increase of between 19.5% and 19.8%, as well as a “modest sales increase in local currencies”. 
The EBITDA margin for the first six months of 2025 increased to 18.9% year on year, compared with 18.7% in the same period last year. 
“Amid uncertain market development, Sika will continue to grow above the market and is focusing on margin improvement,” the company said in its confirmation of strategic medium-term targets for 2028.

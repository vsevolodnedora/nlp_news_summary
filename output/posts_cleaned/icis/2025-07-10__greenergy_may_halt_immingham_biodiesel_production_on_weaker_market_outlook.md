LONDON (ICIS)–The biodiesel market looks poised for lower supply if UK-based fuels supplier and distributor Greenergy finalizes new plans to shut its UK biodiesel site in Immingham announced on Thursday. 
Greenergy began consulting to cease operations at its biodiesel plant, according to a company statement. This follows [ a strategic review](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00111103164) to evaluate the plant’s commercial viability in May, when production was halted. 
“In light of continuing market pressures, we unfortunately do not have enough certainty on the outlook for UK biofuels policy to make the substantial investments required to create a competitive operation at Immingham,” Greenergy said in its statement. 
The drop in supply as a result of the plant’s potential closure may not necessarily ease market conditions though. This is mainly because of a steady flow of biodiesel from the US. 
UK biodiesel producers are facing sustained headwinds, as lackluster domestic demand collides with a surge in tariff-free imports from the US and heavily subsidized supplies from China, further undermining market competitiveness. 
European major Trafigura acquired Greenergy’s European operations in March 2024. 
Greenergy’s CEO, Adam Trager said he was looking to have “urgent talks” with the government on a higher quota of biofuels in UK petrol and diesel consumption. This would support demand in the biofuels sector, in particular biodiesel. 
Biodiesel, which can be derived from vegetable oils, animal fats, or other waste-based bio-feedstocks, is used as fuel in diesel engines.

LONDON (ICIS)–Covestro has downgraded its outlook for 2025 due to an ongoing weak global economy with no signs of a short-term recovery, it said on Friday. 
The Germany-headquartered polymers producer cut its forecast for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), as well as two other key financial metrics. 
Covestro outlined its revisions in a statement released ahead of its second-quarter earnings, due to be published on 31 July. 
The company’s adjusted forecast is as follows: 
  * EBITDA is expected to be between €700 million and €1.1 billion. The previous forecast projected EBITDA between €1.0 billion and €1.4 billion. 
  * Free operating cash flow (FOCF) is expected to be between €-400 million and €+100 million. The previous forecast projected FOCF between €0 million and €300 million. 
  * Return on capital employed over weighted average cost of capital (ROCE over WACC) is expected to be between -9 and -5 percentage points. The previous forecast projected ROCE over WACC between -6 and -3 percentage points. 


Preliminary EBITDA for the second quarter amounted to €270 million, within the forecast range €200 million-€300 million, Covestro said. 
The producer’s first quarter EBITDA [halved year on year](https://subscriber.icis.com/search/news/petchem/news-article-00111098227) though was at the upper end of its forecast.

SINGAPORE (ICIS)–Neste will supply 7,400 tonnes (9.5 million liters) of unblended sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to DHL Express at Singapore’s Changi Airport beginning this month for a year, the Finland-based company said on Tuesday. 
The SAF, which will account for approximately 35% to 40% of the overall fuel blend composition of DHL Express’ fleet of Boeing five 777 freighters, is produced at Neste’s refinery in Tuas, located in southwest Singapore. 
“We are excited to expand our cooperation with DHL to Singapore, a leading aviation hub in Asia-Pacific,” said Carl Nyberg, senior vice president, Commercial, Renewable Products at Neste. 
“It leverages our SAF production and supply capabilities in Singapore, and demonstrates how we are working with DHL globally to help the company achieve its air transportation decarbonization targets using a solution that is available at scale today,” Nyberg added. 
Said Christopher Ong, managing director for DHL Express Singapore: “This partnership with Neste to procure and uplift SAF for DHL Express’ international air cargo flights from Singapore is a significant milestone for us.” 
“Not only will it enable us to gain new strides in emissions reduction in air transport, it also allows us to strengthen our commitment to customers to provide more sustainable shipping options,” Ong said. 
The agreement will contribute to a target of 1% SAF use on all passenger and cargo flights from 2026 onwards, according to the statement. 
Neste’s SAF, made from renewable waste and residues including used cooking oil and animal fats, is certified for commercial aviation and can be blended up to 50% with conventional jet fuel without infrastructure changes. 
Neste’s global SAF production capacity is 1.5 million tonnes/year, with plans to grow to 2.2 million tonnes/year in 2027.

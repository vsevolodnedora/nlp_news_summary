MADRID (ICIS)–EU chemicals will lose out to US competitors under the tariff regime agreed in the latest US-EU trade deal, which avoids “for the moment” a trade war, Germany’s chemicals trade group VCI said this week. 
  * Both EU and US consumers to lose out – VCI 
  * ‘Structural imbalance’ to weaken EU chemicals further – France Chimie 
  * More robust trade barriers need to be implemented – Spain’s Feique 
  * Deeply-integrated transatlantic chemicals trade to suffer – Europe-wide Cefic 


Other trade groups such as France Chimie were also skeptical about the deal, although it noted “contradictory statements” from the US and the EU, while full details remain unknown. 
The Europe-wide trade group Cefic said the deal “appears to have averted the worst-case scenario” but will still hurt European producers’ competitiveness compared with their US peers and called for “further details” as soon as possible. 
Feique, the Spanish trade group, said the deal will negatively impact on Spanish chemical exports to the US and on exports of intermediates to other EU countries that have the US as their final destination – “eroding trade and investment” flows. 
**STORM BETTER THAN HURRICANE  
** Germany’s VCI, representing the EU’s largest chemicals producer and a key, export-intensive sector for Germany’s manufacturing sector, was relieved that a full-blown trade war had been avoided but added that EU chemical competitiveness will be hurt given the “high” tariffs that the industry faces. 
“Anyone expecting a hurricane is grateful for a storm. Further escalation was avoided. Nevertheless, the price is high for both sides. Europe’s exports are losing competitiveness. US customers are paying the tariffs,” said VCI executive director Wolfgang Grosse Entrup. 
“From the chemical industry’s perspective, the agreed tariffs are too high. At the same time, however, it is good that even higher tariffs were avoided. Now the German government must act even more consistently to offset this additional burden,” he added. 
VCI called for more talks where chemical tariffs in the US and the EU are “significantly reduced” and facilitate the “reindustrialization and transformation” of the chemical sectors in both the EU and the US. 
**‘PRECISE CONTENT’ NEEDED  
** All trade groups called for further details of the deal to be published as soon as possible. However, the latest news has been enough for most to be worried. 
France Chimie said it was observing with “seriousness and concern” details published so far, saying in principle, it would put EU chemicals at a disadvantage. 
In addition, it said there had been “contradictory statements” from both parties and called for the “precise content” of the agreement to be released as soon as possible. 
It was very troubled, it added, about the terms and conditions which will determine trade in chemical products and active pharmaceutical ingredients due to the lack of detail. 
“France Chimie notes with concern that, according to the information provided, the agreement would introduce a difference in treatment between US chemical companies and our European companies, which would be subject to additional costs for exporting to the US,” said France Chimie. 
“This structural imbalance would seriously penalize an already weakened European chemical industry, unless the ‘zero for zero’ system is extended to all chemical products.” 
France Chimie said it was essential for the European Commission – the EU’s executive arm – to strengthen measures announced in its action plan earlier in July, and insisted it was “urgent” to implement them. 
“[The implementation is key] in order to restore operating conditions to the level of competitiveness of other competing areas for European manufacturers. This involves in particular: the guarantee of access to decarbonized energy at a competitive cost, an essential condition for preserving industrial activity in Europe. 
“Reduction of taxes and charges on industrial sites, to align them with international standards; [and] simplification of the European regulatory framework and the fight against national over-transpositions.” 
**‘AGILITY’ TO IMPLEMENT TRADE BARRIERS  
** Spain’s trade group Feique said, subject to full details, the deal would “exert significant pressure” on Spanish chemical exports to the US, which in 2024 reached €3.5 billion of total exports of €59.2 billion, including industrial chemicals and pharmaceuticals. 
It said impact was likely to be higher on exports of commodity chemicals rather than specialized products due to their greater exposure to international competition. However, it said the EU should work hard to lower the tariffs faced by the chemicals industry. 
“It is extremely important for the sector (as for many other industries) to work on including chemicals in the ‘zero-for-zero’ agreement, and even to develop a comprehensive and balanced sectoral agreement that guarantees favorable trading conditions, increases predictability, and strengthens the competitiveness of our industry,” said Feique. 
“The Commission must redouble its efforts to develop the EU’s free trade agenda, with the aim of opening new markets. In this context, Europe must also be more agile in implementing trade defense measures, especially by monitoring strategic products and applying anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures when necessary.” 
Earlier this month, director general Juan Labat [told ICIS](https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00111122350/) that the EU must redouble efforts to protect its domestic industry, lowering taxes and upping public support for energy-intensive sectors such as chemicals, and tackle the high energy cost problem. 
“Despite increased renewable generation and lower operating costs, electricity prices have doubled compared to pre-pandemic levels, and gas prices have consolidated at the same rate, fundamentally affecting basic industrial activities across the continent and seriously jeopardizing strategic autonomy,” concluded Feique. 
**INVESTMENTS HINDERED  
** In Brussels, the EU capital, trade group Cefic said it required more details about the deal before it could make a complete assessment, but it warned that tariffs on chemicals could jeopardize investments on both side of the Atlantic. 
However, it said the inclusion of some chemicals in the ‘zero-for-zero’ agreement was an “encouraging” sign on which the Commission could continue building upon, adding “beneficial trade terms” were needed for all chemicals. 
“While the deal appears to have averted the worst-case scenario, the additional US tariffs on EU exports risk further eroding the competitiveness of the EU chemical industry. This is another reminder that the recently published Chemical Industry Action Plan needs to be urgently and fully implemented. There is no time to waste,” said Cefic. 
“Additional tariffs hinder trade and investment flows across the Atlantic. This is highly problematic for such an integrated transatlantic chemical industry with a significant amount of intra-industry and intra-company trade. Raw and input materials are regularly being shipped back and forth across the Atlantic, adding value at each stage of production.”

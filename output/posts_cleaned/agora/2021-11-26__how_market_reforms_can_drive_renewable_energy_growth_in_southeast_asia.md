**What this event is about**
Southeast Asia is emerging as a global economic powerhouse, attracting record levels of foreign investment and experiencing surging electricity demand. With abundant renewable energy resources and growing interest from investors, the region is well-positioned for a rapid scale-up of solar and wind power. While several countries are making strides, there is significant untapped potential for further growth.
In response, **Agora Energiewende** , **NewClimate Institute** and **the Energy Research Institute (ERI)** **Thailand** have developed a new report under the project **Clean, Affordable, and Secure Energy in Southeast Asia (CASE)** – in collaboration with **GIZ** , who leads the consortium.
The report "Electricity market designs in Southeast Asia: Harnessing opportunities for renewable energy growth in Indonesia"_Thailand, Viet Nam, and the Philippines_ , highlights key market and regulatory opportunities to accelerate solar and wind power deployment in ASEAN’s leading economies – outlining strategies to enhance investment certainty in renewables, unlock system flexibility, and reorganise power systems to deliver clean, affordable electricity.
In this 1.5-hour webinar, we presented the report’s key findings and examined their implications for each of the four countries. The session included a presentation of the report, followed by a panel discussion featuring country experts, including 
  * **Alberto Dalasung III**(Institute for Climate and Sustainable Cities, the Philippines),
  * **Bui Ngoc Thuy**(Senior Energy Advisor, GIZ Energy Support Programme, Viet Nam),
  * **Dr Phimsupha Kokchang**(Energy Research Institute - Chulalongkorn University, Thailand), and
  * **Dr Marlistya Citraningrum**(Institute for Essential Services Reform, Indonesia).

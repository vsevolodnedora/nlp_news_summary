**What this event is about**
Transitioning to cleaner energy is essential to achieving national climate targets and long-term sustainability. As regions in China and across Europe work towards shifting away from coal, with careful planning, they can foster new and diversified economic opportunities, create sustainable jobs and strengthen resilience.
A fair and smooth transition to climate neutrality will require coal regions to diversify their economies and create sustainable employment opportunities that benefit residents and communities. Tailored, region-specific solutions are key to overcoming unique challenges, but sharing best practices and successful case studies across regions can offer valuable insights. Since 2021, **Agora Energiewende** and **Agora Energy Transition China** , in partnership with **Energy Foundation China** , has been leading this initiative to promote a just and inclusive energy transition for coal regions, with new opportunities for growth and innovation.
By comparing transition pathways from Shanxi, Shaanxi and coal regions in several European countries, Agora aims to address employment challenges while building more resilient, sustainable regional economies. This event joined diverse perspectives from Shanxi, Shaanxi, Germany, Poland, Greece and the UK to explore how economic diversification can drive a just transition.

Creating a climate neutral economy will require the availability of large quantities of clean hydrogen, particularly in hard-to abate industrial sectors. Such hydrogen will increasingly be produced on the basis of renewable electricity at a variety of sites in Europe. The question is: What is the most cost-effective way to deliver hydrogen to the centres of industrial demand?
In this context, Agora Energiewende – with its partner AFRY Management Consulting – published a new study “No-regret hydrogen. Charting early steps for H2 infrastructure in Europe” (you can find the link to the study in the "All content" area further down). The online event offered the opportunity to present these results and discuss perspectives on specific policy needs from the EU level as part of the European Green Deal in 2021. Key questions included:
  * What counts as inescapable hydrogen demand, and where will it be located?
  * Which combination of production and storage technologies will be the most cost-effective at serving the demand?
  * Where are early opportunities for hydrogen infrastructure development?
  * What are next steps for EU policymaking on hydrogen?


The study was presented by the authors **Angus Paxton, Principal at AFRY Management Consulting** , and **Matthias Deutsch, Senior Associate at Agora Energiewende**.  
**Joachim Balke, Head of Unit “Infrastructure and Regional Cooperation”, Directorate General for Energy at the European Commission** , commented on the subject and **Frank Peter, Head of Industry at Agora Energiewende** , moderated the discussion.
The 1.5 hour event was held in English and gained the attention of almost 650 attendees from all over the world.

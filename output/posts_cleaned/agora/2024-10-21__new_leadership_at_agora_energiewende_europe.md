**Brussels, 21 October 2024.** The energy and climate think tank Agora Energiewende has appointed Émeline Spire as its new Director Europe, starting on 21 October 2024. She takes over from Matthias Buck who initiated and has led Agora’s Europe work since 2015.
Up until now, Émeline Spire was responsible for Agora Energiewende’s global work on the power system transformation. As she moves into her new role, Dimitri Pescia, current Director Southeast and East Asia, becomes Director Power Systems Transformation and will thus lead Agora’s global work on this topic. In their new roles, Émeline Spire and Dimitri Pescia report to the Executive Directors of Agora Think Tanks. 
Before joining Agora, Spire worked in various roles in the European energy sector for over twenty years, with a focus on EU policies and renewables integration. An engineer and economist by training, she was director for markets and energy transition at the French energy regulator CRE until 2023. She has also held leadership positions at the French power exchange and the Belgian TSO Elia Group. 
Frauke Thies, Executive Director, Agora Think Tanks, said:
“Émeline becoming our Europe director opens a new chapter for Agora in Brussels. Staying the course to climate neutrality while navigating geopolitical and economic challenges is a key task for the new EU policy cycle. With her extensive experience in shaping the energy sector transformation – the basis for reaching climate neutrality in other parts of society – and her background in economics, Émeline is well-placed to lead our European work at this critical time for climate action.” 
Émeline Spire said:
“A passionate European, I am honoured to take on the role as Agora’s Europe Director and work with the team of highly skilled and motivated experts. The coming five years will be decisive for the Green Deal’s ambitions to materialise. I aim to ensure that Agora continues to make a difference by delivering robust analyses and policy solutions to help chart the path to a climate-neutral, resilient, competitive and socially just Europe.”

##  About this event 
As Southeast Asia accelerates its clean energy transition, building a resilient and reliable power system is more important than ever. The recent blackout on the Iberian Peninsula put a spotlight on a key aspect of power system operations, namely stability, and how approaches to maintaining stability need to evolve as the share of inverter-based resources in the power system grows.
This webinar offers a constructive look at how Southeast Asia can strengthen power system stability while scaling up wind, solar and battery storage. Using insights from a recent [Agora Energiewende analysis](https://www.agora-energiewende.org/publications/power-system-stability-in-the-age-of-renewable-energy), we will revisit the Iberian blackout and examine its relevance for the Southeast Asian region. The session will highlight key technical lessons, strategies for enhancing grid resilience with inverter-based technologies and practical policy recommendations to support a secure, renewables-based power system.
Agora Energiewende, Energy Research Institute of Chulalongkorn University (Thailand), Institute for Essential Services Reform (IESR) and the Institute for Climate and Sustainable Cities (ICSC) are organising this webinar under the CASE project, in collaboration with GIZ, which leads the consortium.
This session is designed to spark regional dialogue and support forward-looking planning for secure, clean power systems across Southeast Asia. We invite policymakers, regulators, utilities and system planners to join us in this timely conversation.

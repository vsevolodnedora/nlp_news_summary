**What this event is about**
As demand for electricity grows, ensuring a reliable power supply for households and industries is a critical task. Power systems need to generate, transmit and distribute electricity in a stable manner under all conditions. 
With the clean energy transition, wind, solar and batteries gradually replace fossil-based power plants. Renewables-based generation, which is connected non-synchronously via inverters, can provide voltage related system services, but it is more complex for them to provide frequency related services. An essential question in the energy transition debate is thus how such “system services” can be provided most efficiently in the future.
To facilitate well-informed decisions, we commissioned Moeller & Poeller Engineering to carry out a study on the technical aspects of the provision of system services. 
In this webinar, we explained the elements of system stability, system services and technologies providing those services. We further described different strategies, such as carrying out market-based tenders or setting connection requirements to ensure sufficient system service capacity in renewables-based power systems. Findings of the study were discussed with experts from system operators and the wind, gas turbine and battery industry. 
The event lasted 1.5 hours and included a Q&A session.

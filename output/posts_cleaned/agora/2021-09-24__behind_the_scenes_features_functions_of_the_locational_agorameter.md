**What this event is about**
What would locational prices mean for the German power system? A new study by Agora Energiewende explores this question using a comprehensive modelling approach developed in cooperation with Fraunhofer IEE. The analysis shows how local price signals can help to make better use of existing grid capacities, reduce redispatch needs and costs, and support more efficient investment decisions.
In this technical webinar, we walked you through the new Locational Agorameter tool and took a closer look at the model environment and the tool’s implementation. We explained the design process and highlighted how you can use the different visualisations to compare and assess the effects of locational pricing yourself.
Whether you're a modeller, researcher or developer, this session will give you hands-on insights into the interplay of complementary models, the assumptions and optimisation logic behind it and visualisation environments that power the tool.
Watch the recording to dive deeper into the model and explore what smarter market design could look like in practice.

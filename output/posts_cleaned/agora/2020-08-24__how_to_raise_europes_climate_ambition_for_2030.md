The 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26), rescheduled to take place in Glasgow from November 1 to 12, 2021 will be a crucial moment for the Paris Agreement. In applying the accord’s ‘review and ratcheting up’ procedure for the first time, the outcome of the conference will show whether the climate treaty can deliver stronger climate action to close the current gap towards ‘well below 2 degrees’ in global warming. To ensure the success of the conference, the EU has a clear responsibility to make a substantial contribution to increasing climate action by raising its outdated climate target framework.
In this context, the European Commission has announced that by September 2020 it will present a comprehensive plan for increasing the EU’s 2030 climate target to at least 50 per cent and towards 55 per cent greenhouse gas emission reductions compared with 1990 levels. The Commission’s comprehensive plan will be the focus of an intense political debate by parliaments, governments and stakeholders throughout Europe. The Commission will then propose by summer 2021 revisions to all relevant EU policy instruments necessary to deliver the additional reductions of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.
On 24 August, Agora Energiewende released a new report written together with Öko Institut exploring the options for increasing the EU’s 2030 climate ambition to -55 per cent economy-wide.
At the online event on 10 September, **Agora Energiewende’s Executive Director Patrick Graichen** was joined by **Felix Matthes and Jakob Graichen from Öko Institut** to present key findings from the report and discuss their political implications.

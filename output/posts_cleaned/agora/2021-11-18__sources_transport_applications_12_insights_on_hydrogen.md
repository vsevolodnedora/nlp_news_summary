The mounting number of national and regional hydrogen strategies is a signal that after two false starts, the lightest element is being recognised by policymakers as an essential tool on the quest to climate neutrality. However, while the strategies offer clarity on ambitions, they leave a number of critical questions regarding implementation unanswered.
In this context, Agora Energiewende publishe an impulse paper titled “12 insights on hydrogen” on 18 November (download possible from the "All Content" section fruther down). Therefore, the online event on 18 November served as a great opportunity to present the twelve insights to the public and to discuss their relevance to implementation of hydrogen strategies in the 2020s.  
Key questions addressed include:
  * In which applications is hydrogen indispensable?
  * From which sources should sustainable hydrogen be obtained?
  * How should hydrogen be stored and transported?
  * What are the implications for trade?


**Gniewomir Flis** , Project Manager Hydrogen at Agora Energiewende and main author of the impulse paper, presented the insights. Additionally, **Kirsten Westphal** , Member of the National Hydrogen Council and Senior Associate at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, commented on the paper.

The EU basic materials industry is under pressure. Over the past weeks, for the first time the EU Emissions Trading System saw carbon prices above 50€/t of CO2. Moreover, meeting the new EU 2030 climate target of -55 per cent (relative to 1990 levels) will require the deployment of key low-carbon technologies before 2030. What are these technologies in the steel, chemical and cement sectors and how could a concrete policy architecture look like to incentivise their deployment before 2030?
The EU has just released its updated Industrial Strategy. Moreover, it is discussing the introduction of a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) to guarantee a level playing field for industry. Do these measures rise up to the challenge?
In this 1.5-hour webinar Agora Energiewende and Wuppertal Institute analysed the state of play of the EU industry transition and described the policy gaps that need filling to kickstart the EU industry transition before 2030.

**What this event is about**
Ammonia is the main building block for synthetic nitrogen fertilisers. Its current production accounts for 1-2 percent of global energy-related emissions. Almost all greenhouse gas emissions linked to the production of nitrogen fertilisers can be eliminated when replacing fossil-based ammonia with ammonia made from renewable hydrogen. Dedicating renewable hydrogen to the production of synthetic nitrogen fertilisers is thus widely regarded as a no-regret use.
Echoing the hype around global hydrogen projects, announcements of renewable ammonia and low-carbon fertiliser projects are plentiful. However, actual production of renewable nitrogen fertilisers is barely picking up. At Agora, we actively track projects driving this critical transformation.  
Our new interactive mapping tool sheds light on the few projects spearheading this transformation. We anticipate an increase of renewable fertiliser initiatives in the coming years and will continuously update our tool to reflect these developments.
In this 1.5-hour webinar, we delved into the opportunities and challenges with a distinguished panel of experts, including:
  * **Theresa von Saldern** , German Federal Foreign Office and
  * **Marc van Doorn** , Director of green developments, Grupo Fertiberia


Together, we explored what it takes to accelerate the transition towards renewable nitrogen fertiliser production. Watch the recording to see an engaging discussion with insights, solutions and a roadmap for a more sustainable fertiliser industry!

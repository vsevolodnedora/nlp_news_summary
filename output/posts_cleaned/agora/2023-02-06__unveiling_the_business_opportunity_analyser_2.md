#### What this event is about
Renewable hydrogen has the potential to play an important role in the just transition towards a net-zero economy, both in developed and developing countries. Industrialised economies with high energy needs and limited renewable resource potential will require imported renewable hydrogen and hydrogen-based products to achieve their decarbonisation goals. On the other hand, renewable-rich countries with large potential for green hydrogen development, mostly located in the Global South, view the hydrogen economy as an opportunity to enhance their socio-economic development as well as contribute to global decarbonisation.
Under the umbrella of the International PtX (Power-to-X) Hub, Agora Industry, in collaboration with the Öko-Institut, launched the Business Opportunity Analyser (BOA) version 1.0 in June 2023. Since then, the tool has been further improved and turned into a web application with all the features of version 1.0. In addition, an optimisation methodology has been implemented to calculate cost-optimal capacities and load factors of the individual system components.
The tool will enable users to calculate the delivered cost of PtX molecules from an export country to an import country, highlighting the competitive edge of one country against another. This "pre-feasibility" level information will assist in identifying regions with promising business opportunities within the PtX value chain. Such information will also support policymakers in understanding their country's specific PtX cost potentials, thereby assisting in the development of targeted policies to facilitate investment in PtX value chains. The BOA will have a global scope covering most of the potential export and import countries, including a deep dive analysis with greater regional detail for Argentina, Morocco and South Africa.
At this webinar colleagues from Agora Industry and Öko Institute provided an introduction to the PtX Business Opportunity Analyser version 2.0, explaining the structure, data, outputs and other important features of the BOA. The event lasted somewhat over an hour, with commentaries from

as well as a Q&A session with the audience at the end.

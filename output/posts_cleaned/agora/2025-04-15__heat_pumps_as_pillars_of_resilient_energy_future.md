**What this event is about**
Widely used in cooling, refrigeration and in heating buildings and water, heat pumps are a proven technology – and the most cost-effective one to decarbonise buildings. But to replace the fossil fuels that currently meet most global heating demand, the deployment of clean technologies like heat pumps must accelerate significantly. This is essential to meet global climate goals, strengthen energy security and boost competitiveness of cleantech industry.
We heard from international experts who offered technical guidance to policymakers on how to scale up heat pump markets to deliver the greatest climate and consumer benefits. The joint event by the Regulatory Assistance Project (RAP) and Agora Energiewende featured an updated “heat pump toolkit” for policymakers and insights into policies which could support EU-wide efforts to accelerate the transition to clean heating.
The presentations by **Louise Sunderland** (Regulatory Assistance Project) and **Steffen Verheyen** (Agora Energiewende) were followed by a panel discussion with speakers from the Regulatory Assistance Project, Agora Energiewende, CLASP and the International Energy Agency. There was a Q&A session at the end.

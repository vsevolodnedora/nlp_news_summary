## About this event
Southeast Asia’s steel-intensive economies – Indonesia, Thailand, Viet Nam, Malaysia, and the Philippines – are emerging as key players in the global steel sector. Rapid industrialisation and infrastructure growth have pushed the region’s steel demand to around 4 per cent of the global total. However, with most production still reliant on high-emission technologies, the sector faces growing pressure to adapt.
To meet climate goals and stay globally competitive, the region must act now. Over 90 per cent of existing blast furnaces will require reinvestment between 2030 and 2040, offering a crucial window to shift to low-carbon technologies. A clear and coordinated strategy can help Southeast Asia leapfrog to cleaner production while avoiding long-term carbon lock-in.
In response, Agora Industry and Agora Energiewende have developed a [new report](https://www.agora-industry.org/publications/decarbonising-steel-in-southeast-asia), laying out a roadmap for steel decarbonisation in Southeast Asia. The study highlights how the region can align industrial growth with climate targets while building economic resilience and future-ready industries.
This webinar presented the key findings of our new report “Steel decarbonisation in Southeast Asia: Tapping into opportunities and enabling conditions”. It brings together policymakers, industry leaders, financiers, and researchers to discuss actionable strategies for transforming steel production and supporting a just low-carbon transition.

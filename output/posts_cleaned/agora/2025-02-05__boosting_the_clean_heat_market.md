**What this event is about**
The heating transition in Europe is at a pivotal moment. The sales of clean heating appliances are slowing down, while the current policy framework fails to deliver the necessary signals to drive the decarbonisation of the heating market. Consequently, both manufacturers and consumers hesitate to fully embrace clean heating solutions, putting the future competitiveness of European heat pump manufacturing at risk.
Against this backdrop, Agora Energiewende has conducted extensive research and stakeholder consultation on the potential role of market-based policies to support the clean transition of the EU heating market. Building on the policy example of the UK Clean Heat Market Mechanism, our analysis uncovers key insights and outlines considerations for designing such a policy at the EU level.
In this hybrid event, we presented the key conclusions from our work and discuss the policy lessons from the UK’s experience and how these could shape the European heating transition. The presentation was followed by a panel discussion with EU policymakers and representatives from industry and civil society, exploring the role such market-based policies could play in the next EU policy cycle.

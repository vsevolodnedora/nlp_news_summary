**About this event**
As the world navigates a complex and rapidly evolving geopolitical landscape, strengthening international cooperation remains essential for advancing a clean energy future. In particular, resilient and pragmatic collaboration between China and the European Union can play a key role. There is growing opportunity to foster structured dialogue that connects national strategies with local realities on both sides.
This half-day hybrid multilateral workshop – the 5th in the Europe-China clean energy transition series – will bring together diverse perspectives from China, Poland, Germany, Spain and the EU to explore practical and inclusive pathways for international cooperation on coal transition. The workshop convenes stakeholders from government, academia, civil society and industry to engage in forward-thinking discussions across three key themes:
  * Regional development priorities, the shared challenges of moving beyond coal and emerging areas for collaboration;
  * The role of international research, knowledge exchange and industrial partnerships in supporting green development at the local level; and
  * The socio-economic dimensions of the transition, with a focus on policies and mechanisms that offer replicable lessons and foster inclusive, just outcomes.


This dialogue, hosted by Agora Energy Transition China and Agora Energiewende, aimed to strengthen mutual understanding, identify common ground and unlock new avenues for cooperation.

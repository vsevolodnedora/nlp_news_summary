**What this event is about**
The EU has set itself a binding target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55 percent by 2030 and become climate neutral by 2050. The targets require a drastic acceleration of renewable energy production, including for covering a growing demand from heat pumps, electric vehicles and electrified industrial processes. Most of the new generators and consumers will be connected to the distribution grids which were historically not dimensioned for such increased loads. Consequently, the grids are expected to be more frequently congested.
Electric cars, heat pumps and home storage systems can help overcome this challenge and maximise the potential for renewables deployment. They make the system much more flexible by shifting production and consumption to times when sufficient network capacity is available. Utilising those flexibilities can enable connecting new grid users faster and thus reduce investment needs in the long run.
The webinar presented key findings and recommendations by Agora based on research carried out by DNV, and another Agora publication looking at how household flexibilities such as EVs and heat pumps can reduce electricity costs for all. We discussed these topics with stakeholders representing regulators, distribution system operators and the renewable electricity generation sector.

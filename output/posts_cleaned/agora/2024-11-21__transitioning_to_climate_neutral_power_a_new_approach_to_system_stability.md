As the world accelerates its shift towards renewable energy, ensuring the stability of power systems remains a critical task. Traditional solutions built around the mechanical properties of conventional power plants are no longer sufficient in a renewables-based energy landscape. 
The transition to climate-neutral power generation, primarily driven by wind and solar power alongside battery technologies, thus demands a new approach to ensure electricity grids maintain frequency and voltage stability. Based on a technical analysis carried out by Moeller & Poeller Engineering, a new Agora publication outlines several approaches for ensuring the stability of renewables-base power systems. 
**Thorough assessment of needs and tailored approach**
On the road to climate-neutral power generation, system operators and regulators need to carefully assess whether the existing grid infrastructure has adequate stability resources. Misjudging the need for these resources - either by over- or underestimating them - can have costly consequences. Overestimation could lead to unnecessary investments and delays in integrating more renewable energy sources, while underestimation increases the risk of disturbances in the grid affecting consumers, the authors note.
According to Agora, using the most cost-effective resources at the relevant location should be the guiding principle when deciding on the most appropriate approach to system stability.
**Collaboration key to finding effective solutions**
A central element in designing effective system stability solutions is ensuring a common understanding among all stakeholders. System operators, energy producers, storage operators and relevant authorities should engage in dialogues to accurately identify and address stability needs. 
Having a shared understanding of technical terminology is essential to facilitate alignment. The ongoing revision of European network codes presents a timely opportunity to streamline approaches to grid stability. Furthermore, harmonised EU-wide standards would help make clean technology supply chains more efficient and thus support the transition to climate-neutral power systems. 
As the energy transition gathers pace, securing a stable, reliable and cost-efficient power grid will be one of the most important tasks for policymakers, system operators and the private sector. Ensuring that stability solutions are fit for purpose and efficiently deployed will be essential to achieving a climate-neutral future.

Reaching the Paris goals requires a deep transformation of the way we produce and consume. The global steel sector offers an unprecedented opportunity to contribute to net zero. A just transformation of the sector requires that governments, private companies, industry associations and other civil society organizations identify and facilitate the necessary levers for reducing emissions quickly by the dissemination of near zero emission technologies and the establishment of markets for green products.
During this high-level event that was jointly organised by the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, Lund University, Wuppertal Institute, the Leadership Group for Industry Transition (LeadIT) and Agora Industry, panellists discussed challenges and opportunities of a just global steel transformation that starts in the 2020s.
As an input for the panel discussion, **Jesse Scott** , Director International Programme at Agora Energiewende, presented the key findings of a joint paper by Agora Industry, Wuppertal Institute and Lund University entitled “Global Steel at a Crossroads”, that was published on the same day and can be found in the section "All Content" further down. Agora Industry is the new sub-brand of Agora Energiewende launched in October 2021.
The following high-level panelists discussed challenges and opportunities of a just transformation of the global steel sector:
  * **Sharan Burrow** , General Secretary, International Trade Union Confederation
  * **Aditya Mittal** , CEO, ArcelorMittal
  * **Bernhard Osburg** , CEO, thyssenkrupp Steel Europe
  * **Anne-Claire Howard** , CEO, ResponsibleSteel
  * **Andrew Purvis** , Director Safety, Environment and Technology, World Steel Association
  * **Jochen Flasbarth** , State Secretary, German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety


Questions for discussion:
  * When do we need to produce green steel at scale and bring it to the market, in the light of long-term capital investment cycles and 1.5°C pathways?
  * What does a just transformation mean for the global steel sector?
  * Which national and international instruments and measures are needed for a rapid and just transition?


The discussion was moderated by **Stefan Lechtenböhme** r, Lund University/Wuppertal Institute, and **Gökce Mete** , Leadership Group for Industry Transition (LeadIT).

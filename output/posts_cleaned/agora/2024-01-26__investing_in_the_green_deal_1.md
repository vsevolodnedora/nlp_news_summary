**What this event is about**
This EU legislative period will be characterised by the implementation of the EU Green Deal and the “Fit-for-55” package. It includes over 50 laws, aimed at aligning European economic growth, competitiveness and job creation with reaching climate neutrality by 2050 at the latest. 
The transition will have important macroeconomic implications and require large-scale investments. What will those implications look like and how can Europe ensure the necessary investments to make the transition a success? 
This webinar seeked to answer those questions. Agora Energiewende presented two new studies: the first one is a model-based macroeconomic analysis done in collaboration with Oxford Economics, of the economic and fiscal implications of Agora Energiewende’s EU Gas Exit Pathway, a techno-economic roadmap to the EU’s 2050 climate-neutrality goal. The second paper outlines both short- and medium-term solutions to improve the quality and secure the quantity of EU climate funding needed to successfully implement the EU Green Deal. 
The event lasted one hour and fifteen minutes and included a Q&A session.

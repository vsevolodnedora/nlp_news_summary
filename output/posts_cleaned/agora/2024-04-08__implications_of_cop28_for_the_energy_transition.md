**What this event is about**
COP28 marked the conclusion of the first global stocktake of efforts to address climate change under the Paris Agreement, highlighting the urgent need for governments to accelerate the green transition. Despite differing priorities during the intense two-week negotiations, the agreements reached at COP28 are important milestones in the global energy transition – the “beginning of the end” of the fossil fuel era and 118 parties pledging to triple renewable energy capacity and double energy efficiency improvements by 2030. Europe and China are key players in fulfilling these commitments and closing the gap between climate ambition and action.
On 8 April 2024, the Embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany and Agora Energy Transition China co-hosted the second Climate Talk in Beijing. Notably, climate envoys from Denmark, France, Germany and the Netherlands, as well as Chinese experts with a background in policy research, were invited to address the challenges and opportunities in the energy transition. The focus was on exploring perspectives from both Europe and China towards achieving a net-zero future for all.

**Brussels, 10 June 2024.** "The election results underline the importance of topics such as affordable energy, security, safe jobs and competitiveness. Responding to this requires ensuring clean and secure energy supplies and competitive European industry. For example, accelerating investments into domestic, clean energy sources will lower costs for consumers and make Europe less dependent on expensive fossil fuel imports.The election results also underscore the need for a robust European industrial strategy that provides certainty for companies to invest into a climate-neutral future, and ensures adequate levels of domestic cleantech manufacturing to strengthen Europe’s sovereignty. The past five years have firmly established the Green Deal as the EU’s growth strategy on its path to climate neutrality. The main task for the next five years is to make sure that citizens and businesses fully benefit from the transition."

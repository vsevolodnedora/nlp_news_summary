Steel is a fundamental basic material in numerous industries and its demand is on the rise globally. At the same time, the steel industry is amongst the highest CO2 emitting sectors. For these reasons, it is a key player in the transition to climate-neutral industry and global efforts to limit climate change. The sector is often labeled as a hard-to-abate sector but has the potential to turn into a fast-to-abate sector _._
In this webinar, **Prof. Stefan Lechtenböhmer** , Head of Department Future Energy and Industrial Systems, Wuppertal Institute, and **Wido Witecka** , Project Manager, Agora Industry, presented the main results of a joint project as summarised in the publication “15 Insights on the global steel transformation”. After setting the scene, we invited stakeholders from industry, science and civil society to comment on the results and joined us in a panel discussion.
The event was scheduled to span a duration of two hours, included an interactive Q&A session with the audience in the end.

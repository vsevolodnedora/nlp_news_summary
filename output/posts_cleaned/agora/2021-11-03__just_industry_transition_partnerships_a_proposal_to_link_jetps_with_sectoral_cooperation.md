##  Agora Industry event at COP28 
**What this event is about**
Together with the Wuppertal Institute, Kassel University and Lund University, Agora Industry is hosting a debate at COP28 in Dubai on international cooperation for the decarbonisation of basic materials industries using the example of steel.
Proposals for _Just Industry Transition Partnerships_ would result in support for green iron production in the global south that, in turn, would help establish sustainable supply chains and accelerate the decarbonisation of industry in donor countries.
The invited speakers are:
  * Max Åhman, Lund University
  * Srestha Banerjee, iForest
  * Lukas Hermwille, Wuppertal Institute
  * Stefan Lechtenböhmer, Uni Kassel
  * **Frank Peter, Agora Industry**
  * Rosana Santos, E+ Energy Transition Institute, Brazil

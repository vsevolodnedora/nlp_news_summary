**About this event**
Accounting for around one third of global carbon emissions, China plays a significant role in shaping the trajectory of global climate action. In 2024, China was responsible for more than half of the world’s increase in wind and solar capacity, demonstrating its central role in advancing the global commitment to triple global renewable energy capacity by 2030. 
This event marked the launch of a new slide deck, providing a detailed and data-driven analysis of China’s 2024/2025 energy and climate developments. The deck delivers key insights on emission trends and intensity, shifts in energy consumption and supply structure, sector-specific transformations, emerging trade-offs and policy signals and much more. By unpacking the numbers behind China’s energy transition and climate change, this analysis helps build a clearer picture of the country’s progress, the challenges ahead and the opportunities for impactful action – both at home and on the global stage.
Co-hosted by Agora Energy China and Agora Energiewende, this event brought together leading experts to walk through the key findings, explore their implications and discuss how data, transparency and collaboration can accelerate the transition to a low-carbon future.

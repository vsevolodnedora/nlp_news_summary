## Gas winter 2024-25 season: prices and demand up, storage down
## 
What is it about?
Today, ACER publishes its [report on trends in the European gas wholesale markets](https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/2025-ACER-Gas-Key-Developments-winter.pdf) during the gas winter season (October 2024 to March 2025). The report also explores gas storage dynamics over the winter and offers an outlook for summer 2025.
### **What trends did ACER monitoring find?**
European gas markets came under more pressure this winter due to higher demand and lower supply.
  * **Wholesale prices increased by 50%** compared to last winter, though regional price variations narrowed.
  * **Gas consumption increased year-on-year** , driven by colder weather than in the past two winters and exceptionally low wind generation. 
  * Despite increased demand and the halt of Russian gas flows via Ukraine,**gas networks avoided congestion** thanks to full storages at the start of winter, expanded LNG infrastructure, and gas consumption remaining structurally lower than pre-crisis levels.
  * **Storage levels ended winter at 34% capacity** , in line with pre-2022 norms but well below 2023-2024 levels. Significant injections will be needed before next winter.
  * LNG imports rose seasonally but stayed below early winter 2023 levels. Later in the season, with European gas wholesale prices exceeding Asian spot LNG prices and new US liquification coming online, EU LNG imports hit record monthly highs.


###  **Looking ahead**
To meet summer 2025 gas needs and refill EU gas storage to 90% by next winter, ACER estimates that pipeline flows must remain high and LNG imports will need to increase by 20% compared to summer 2024.

## ACER amends the methodology for harmonising cross-zonal electricity balancing capacity allocation
## 
What is it about?
In [July 2024](https://www.acer.europa.eu/news-and-events/news/acer-decide-amending-methodology-harmonising-cross-zonal-electricity-balancing-capacity-allocation), ACER received a proposal from Transmission System Operators (TSOs) to amend the [methodology for harmonising cross-zonal capacity allocation for the exchange of balancing capacity or sharing of reserves](https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Individual%20Decisions_annex/ACER_Decision_11-2023_on_HCZCAM-Annex%20I.pdf). 
After [consulting with stakeholders](https://acer.europa.eu/documents/public-consultations/pc2024e08-public-consultation-amending-harmonised-electricity-cross-zonal-capacity-allocation-methodology) in the autumn of 2024, ACER revised the TSOs’ proposal. Today, with its [Decision 01-2025](https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Individual%20Decisions/ACER_Decision_01-2025_HCZCAM.pdf), ACER has adopted the [amended methodology](https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Individual%20Decisions_annex/ACER_Decision_01-2025_Annex_II.pdf).
The methodology (approved by ACER in [2023](https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Individual%20Decisions/ACER_Decision_11-2023_on_Harmonised_Cross-Zonal_Capacity_Allocation_Methodology.pdf)) harmonises the processes (i.e., market-based and co-optimisation) that compare the market value of cross-zonal capacity between balancing capacity and day-ahead electricity markets. These processes rely on an algorithm that optimises the allocation of available cross-zonal capacity in a way that maximises overall market welfare.
#### **Why did ACER amend the methodology and what’s new?**
The updated methodology:
  * clarifies the governance of the market-based process to ensure its efficient implementation and operation;
  * allows to establish rules for distributing congestion income resulting from cross-zonal capacity allocation among TSOs.


ACER’s Decision also grants TSOs more time to develop the harmonised market-based software and offers flexibility to those already operating regional market-based processes to adapt to the methodology’s new requirements.
#### **What are the next steps?**
TSOs are required to develop the harmonised market-based software by June 2026.
Full implementation of the harmonised market-based allocation process is not expected before September 2027, pending approval from the relevant National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs).

As Europe moves away from Russian fossil fuels, liquified natural gas (LNG) is becoming an increasingly important flexible supply source. But with future gas demand uncertain, the EU faces a trade-off: securing higher LNG volumes to ensure stabler pricing, while maintaining the flexibility to avoid over-contracting in a changing market.
### **ACER’s 2025 Monitoring Report highlights:**
  * LNG’s share of the EU’s total gas supply rose from 23% in 2020 to around 40% in 2024.
  * The EU remained the world’s largest LNG importer, with 112 bcm imported despite a 17% drop from 2023.
  * The US supplied nearly 50% of EU LNG imports, while Russian LNG to EU increased by 22%, despite sanctions. 
  * Over 550 EU spot LNG trades with delivery were reported to ACER, totalling 45.5 bcm – 55% of which were priced below 35 EUR/MWh.
  * The EU purchased 30 bcm of LNG on the spot market, more than any other major importer.
  * The EU faces up to 90 bcm of demand uncertainty between [Fit for 55](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal/delivering-european-green-deal/fit-55-delivering-proposals_en) and [REPowerEU scenarios](https://commission.europa.eu/publications/key-documents-repowereu_en), which could lead to 30 bcm in additional LNG demand by 2030 (compared to 2024 levels) and prolonged reliance on the spot market.


### **ACER recommendations**
To manage future gas demand uncertainty and price risks, key actions are needed from policymakers, network operators and market players:
  * Accelerate decarbonisation efforts to reduce structural gas demand through faster deployment of renewables and improved energy efficiency.
  * Secure additional LNG through flexible contracts to help reduce short-term exposure to price volatility.
  * Improve coordination and effective data-sharing between Member States and the European Commission to enable better monitoring of decarbonisation progress and guide LNG procurement.

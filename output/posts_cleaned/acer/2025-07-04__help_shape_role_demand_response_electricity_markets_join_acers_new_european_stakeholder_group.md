## Help shape the role of demand response in electricity markets: Join ACER’s new European stakeholder group
## 
What is it about?
ACER is establishing a new European Stakeholder Group on demand response in the electricity sector. We invite associations that could offer a pan-European perspective on electricity markets to join. 
### **What’s the background?**
On 7 March 2025, ACER submitted its [proposal for a new EU-wide network code on demand response](https://www.acer.europa.eu/documents/search?search_api_fulltext=ACER+Recommendation+01-2025) to the European Commission, in line with its [framework guideline](https://acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Official_documents/Acts_of_the_Agency/Framework_Guidelines/Framework%20Guidelines/FG_DemandResponse.pdf).
ACER’s proposal sets out common rules to ensure that demand response resources (such as consumers, storage providers and distributed generation) can fully participate in wholesale electricity markets, providing flexibility to the grid.
To support the implementation of these rules, ACER committed to coordinating stakeholder engagement on demand response topics by establishing a new dedicated European Stakeholder Group.
### What will the demand response group do? 
The Demand Response European Stakeholder Group (DRESG) will act as an EU-level platform where ACER, the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) and the EU Distribution System Operators Entity (EU DSO Entity) engage with stakeholders on key matters of demand response. The group will focus on:
  * discussing proposals for terms and conditions or methodologies required by the new network code;
  * addressing broader issues related to demand response; and
  * supporting the practical implementation of the network code.


Through this new stakeholder group, participating associations will:
  * Monitor the implementation progress of the code, including how newly established processes function at local, regional and EU level.
  * Share views and feedback on the code’s implementation, ensuring stakeholder input is taken into account.
  * Support more informed decision-making on the methodologies and rules to be developed under the code.


By doing so, the group will support the flexibility required by the EU electricity system (increasingly powered by renewable energy), strengthening energy security and advancing the EU’s transition to clean energy.
### **Who can join?**
Associations that could offer pan-European views on demand response in electricity markets are encouraged to apply. Bring your insights to the table and ensure that your voice shapes the future of demand response!
Deadline to apply is 15 August 2025, with the first meeting planned for October 2025. [See how to apply](https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/en/Electricity/Documents/Demand-response-ESG-How-to-apply-2025.pdf).

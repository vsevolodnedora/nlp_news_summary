## ACER acknowledges improvements in Regional Coordination Centres’ reporting and encourages further progress
## 
What is it about?
Today, ACER publishes its [second monitoring report](https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/ACER-2025-RCC-Monitoring-report.pdf) on the reporting obligations of Regional Coordination Centres (RCCs).
[Regional Coordination Centres (RCCs)](https://www.acer.europa.eu/electricity/about-electricity/clean-energy-package/new-electricity-regulation) were introduced in 2022 under the [Electricity Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019R0943) to facilitate coordination among electricity transmission system operators (TSOs) across regions. Their aim is to enhance grid stability, foster security of supply, and contribute to the EU’s climate and energy goals.
As part of their reporting obligations, RCCs are required to detail the outcomes of their activities, including:
  * operational performance monitoring;
  * coordinated actions;
  * issued recommendations; and
  * designated tasks.


### **What is ACER’s report about?**
Since 2023, ACER has been monitoring RCC reporting, as required by the [ACER Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32019R0942).
ACER’s second monitoring report provides an overview of how RCCs fulfilled their reporting obligations in 2023, their first full year of operation. The report was drafted in close cooperation with national regulatory authorities (NRAs), with input from the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) and RCCs.
### **What did ACER monitoring find?**
RCCs provided detailed reporting on nine out of sixteen tasks:
  * coordinated capacity calculation;
  * coordinated security analysis;
  * common grid model;
  * consistency defence and restoration plans; 
  * short-term adequacy;
  * outage planning coordination;
  * training and certification; 
  * post-disturbance analysis; and 
  * regional sizing of reserve capacity.


ACER finds that, compared to their initial period of operation ([i.e. the second half of 2022](https://www.acer.europa.eu/news-and-events/news/acer-suggests-improvements-electricity-regional-coordination-centres-reporting), where no tasks were fully implemented by all RCCs), important progress was made. Specifically, all RCCs reported having implemented four tasks: 
  * common grid model;
  * post-disturbance analysis;
  * outage planning coordination; and
  * short-term adequacy.


Additionally, coordinated capacity calculation is now operational in most RCCs, though further development is needed for long-term timeframes.
RCCs reported challenges in the performance of some of their tasks, including:
  * coordinated capacity calculation (e.g. missing or invalid TSOs’ inputs);
  * coordinated security assessment and outage planning coordination (e.g. inadequate IT infrastructure);
  * common grid model (e.g. performance issues); and
  * post-disturbance analysis (e.g. communication issues).


### **What does ACER conclude?**
ACER encourages RCCs to:
  * Ensure swift implementation of their tasks.
  * Clarify how responsibilities are rotated among RCCs.
  * Improve the performance of the common grid model task and regularly report on any obstacles encountered.
  * Extend capacity calculation to cover all timeframes (including long-term and balancing timeframes). 
  * Broaden outage planning coordination to include power-generating modules and demand facilities.
  * Assess whether relevant RCCs can contribute to the system monitoring of TSOs where necessary. 
  * Improve the quality of RCC reporting by providing more detailed and clear information.


### **What are the next steps?**
The next ACER monitoring report is scheduled for late 2025 and will cover the 2024 reporting period (monitored by ACER during 2025).

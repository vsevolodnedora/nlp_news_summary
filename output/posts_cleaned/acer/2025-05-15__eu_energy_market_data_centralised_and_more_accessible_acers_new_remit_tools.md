What is it about?
The Regulation on Wholesale Energy Market Integrity and Transparency ([REMIT](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32011R1227)) is the EU framework that aims to prevent wholesale energy market abuse and support fair competition. When the regulation was [revised](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R1106) in 2024, ACER was tasked with:
  * establishing a REMIT Data Reference Centre to house information on EU wholesale energy market data; and with
  * creating a single Inside Information Access Point.

ACER REMIT Data Reference Centre – a new approach to REMIT data
[ACER’s new REMIT Data Reference Centre](https://aegis.acer.europa.eu/chest/category/56/list) provides access to key data reported under REMIT in one place. This marks a significant step toward increasing transparency in EU wholesale energy markets and offering insights to market participants, analysts and researchers. 
The first release includes nine datasets, accessible via ACER’s [CHEST application](https://aegis.acer.europa.eu/chest/). Users can explore the data interactively online, apply custom filters, and export selected results for further analysis.
This is first time REMIT data is being made available in a downloadable, aggregated, and harmonised format. Unlike previously published data (such as those featured in ACER’s REMIT Quarterly and Monitoring Reports), these are complete datasets, offering users a more comprehensive and usable view of market activities. 
Today’s launch of the ACER REMIT Data Reference Centre is a first step. ACER plans to expand the application with additional datasets and new features in future updates, further reinforcing ACER’s role as a reference centre for wholesale energy market transparency.
These 9 datasets provide insights into trading from January to March 2025. The next update (covering data from April to June 2025) is expected by mid-September. 
The datasets are grouped into the following categories:
**Electricity markets datasets:**  
1. Intraday trading  
2. Day-ahead trading  
3. Long-term trading  
4. Bilateral trading including Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs)  
**Natural gas markets datasets:**  
5. Within-day and Day-ahead trading  
6. Long-term trading  
7. Bilateral trading  
**LNG markets dataset:**  
8. LNG trading  
**Market participants dataset:**  
9. Market participant categorisation
All datasets are available for download in CSV format and are described in detail in the accompanying Catalogue.

ACER Inside Information Access Point – a single gateway to REMIT disclosures
Under REMIT, ‘inside information’ refers to non-public information related to energy market participants or their assets (e.g. outages) that, if made public, would be likely to significantly affect the prices of wholesale energy products. Market players are obliged to disclose such information in a timely way, via Inside Information Platforms (IIPs), to ensure fair and transparent market conditions. IIPs are online platforms, approved by ACER, where market participants disclose inside information.   
  
[ACER’s new Inside Information Access Point](https://www.acer-remit.eu/portal/inside-information-access) serves as a single gateway for inside information that is currently published across 23 approved IIPs, making it easier for market players to check and compare inside information. Better access to planned maintenance and unplanned disruptions of energy assets enhances public understanding of EU energy market dynamics and may support more coordinated asset management by operators and policymakers.
The ACER Inside Information Access Point can also help facilitate the fulfilment of the new REMIT obligations for persons professionally arranging or executing transactions (such as energy exchanges, brokers and capacity allocation platforms). These entities must notify ACER and the relevant national regulatory authorities (NRAs) of any potential breaches caused by a market participant’s failure to disclose inside information. 
### **What kind of inside information is available?**
The ACER Inside Information Access Point collects and displays a range of inside information, including:
  * Planned and unplanned downtimes of energy assets likely to significantly affect the prices of wholesale energy products.
  * Service interruptions across production, transmission, and consumption infrastructure.
  * Outages and maintenance events of both gas and electricity assets.


Users can filter and export inside information data collected by ACER on a given day. ACER plans to continue developing its Access Point, adding new functionalities and improvements to further support market transparency and oversight.
The Access Point is not intended for real-time trading decisions, as its dataset is refreshed daily rather than continuously. Market participants should continue to consult individual [Inside Information Platforms](https://www.acer-remit.eu/portal/list-inside-platforms) for real-time publications of REMIT inside information.

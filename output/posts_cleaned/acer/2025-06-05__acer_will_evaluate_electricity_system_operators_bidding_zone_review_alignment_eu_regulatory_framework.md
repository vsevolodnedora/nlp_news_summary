## ACER will evaluate electricity system operators’ bidding zone review for alignment with the EU regulatory framework
## 
What are bidding zones and why the need to review them? 
Bidding zones are geographical areas where electricity is traded at uniform prices. Within a bidding zone, electricity bids and offers from market participants can be matched without the need to allocate cross-zonal capacity. Currently, most bidding zones in the EU are defined by national borders.
Under the [EU Electricity Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02019R0943-20240716), bidding zones must be configured in a way that maximises economic efficiency and cross-zonal trading opportunities, while ensuring security of supply. To achieve this, a review of the existing bidding zones was needed to identify structural grid congestions and evaluate the potential benefits of alternative configurations.
On 28 April 2025, European transmission system operators (TSOs) [published](https://www.entsoe.eu/news/2025/04/28/bidding-zone-study-released/) their report on the electricity bidding zone review study. The report, which assesses 14 bidding zone configurations across Central and Northern Europe, is intended to support EU Member States in deciding whether to amend or maintain the current bidding zone configurations.
### **What is ACER’s role in the process?**
ACER is responsible for setting the methodology and identifying alternative bidding zone configurations for TSOs to consider in their review.
Hence, in November 2020, ACER issued a [decision](https://www.acer.europa.eu/documents/search?search_api_fulltext=ACER+Decision+29-2020) establishing the bidding zone review methodology. In August 2022, ACER published a [second decision](https://www.acer.europa.eu/documents/search?search_api_fulltext=ACER+Decision+11-2022) on the alternative bidding zone configurations to be considered for Central Europe (Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands) and the Nordic region (Sweden). A [third decision](https://www.acer.europa.eu/documents/search?search_api_fulltext=ACER+Decision+17-2023), covering the Baltic region, was issued in December 2023.
As part of its mandate under the [ACER Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02019R0942-20250205), ACER will also publish an Opinion (addressed to the Council) to assess whether electricity system operators followed the agreed [methodology](https://www.acer.europa.eu/documents/search?search_api_fulltext=ACER+Decision+29-2020) in their bidding zone review study and evaluate the impact of any deviations.
### **What are the next steps?**
ACER aims to publish its Opinion by the end of September 2025. 
Following the publication of the TSOs’ bidding zone report, Member States have six months to decide whether to amend the existing bidding zones. If individual Member States wish to amend their bidding zone configuration, but no unanimous agreement is reached among the relevant parties, the European Commission (after consulting ACER) will have six months to decide.

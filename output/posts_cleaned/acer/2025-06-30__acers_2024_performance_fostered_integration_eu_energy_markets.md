## ACER’s 2024 performance fostered integration of EU energy markets
## 
What is it about?
ACER publishes today its [Consolidated Annual Activity Report for 2024](https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/ACER-Consolidated-Annual-Activity-Report-2024.pdf), which details the Agency’s regulatory activities in relation to:
  * the ongoing integration of Europe’s electricity and gas markets;
  * market surveillance under the Regulation on Wholesale Energy Market Integrity and Transparency (REMIT) and its revision (May 2024).


The report assesses the extent to which ACER met the objectives of its [2024 work programme](https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/en/The_agency/Mission_and_Objectives/Documents/ACER_Programming_Document_2024-2026.pdf) and addresses internal management and governance matters. It was adopted by [ACER's Administrative Board](https://acer.europa.eu/the-agency/organisation-and-bodies/administrative-board) on 6 June 2025, following approval by [ACER's Board of Regulators](https://acer.europa.eu/the-agency/organisation-and-bodies/board-of-regulators).
### **What were the main developments in 2024?**
**Electricity markets:**
  * The process to develop a recommendation for the EU network-code on demand response was initiated (concluded [in March 2025](https://www.acer.europa.eu/news/new-network-code-demand-response-will-further-advance-energy-transition)). The network code aims to empower consumers and aggregators and provide more flexibility to the EU electricity system.
  * A [joint ACER-CEER paper (June 2024)](https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Position%20Papers/ACER_CEER_Network_Grids_Performance_Indicators.pdf) was published, identifying five key challenges for the electricity system.
  * Continued monitoring Member States’ delays in implementing harmonised market rules.
  * A new EU-wide tool to assess system flexibility needs was procured.


**Security of supply and adequacy:**
  * The European Resource Adequacy Assessment [(ERAA) 2023](https://www.acer.europa.eu/news/acer-approves-european-resource-adequacy-assessment-eraa-marking-milestone-security-electricity-supply-across-eu-member-states) was adopted. For the first time since 2020, the comprehensive EU-wide adequacy assessment (which identifies potential capacity gaps through 2024) was approved.
  * ACER monitoring report on [security of EU electricity supply](https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/Security_of_EU_electricity_supply_2024.pdf) was published, comparing national and EU-level adequacy calculations to inform capacity-mechanism decisions.


**Gas monitoring and infrastructure:**
  * [Quarterly gas monitoring reports](https://www.acer.europa.eu/documents/search?search_api_fulltext=key%20developments&f%5B0%5D=area%3A46&f%5B1%5D=date%3A%28min%3A1704067200%2Cmax%3A1735689599%29) and a dedicated [LNG outlook](https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/ACER_2024_MMR_European_LNG_market_developments.pdf) were released, analysing price trends, volatility drivers and supply flows.
  * Expert advice was offered to the European Commission on the revised network code for capacity allocation mechanisms, aimed at aligning tariffs with wider decarbonisation and flexibility goals.
  * Joint work with CEER on an [EU-wide electricity infrastructure report](https://www.acer.europa.eu/monitoring/MMR/electricity_infrastructure_2024).


**Hydrogen market:**
  * [ACER’s first hydrogen market monitoring report](https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/ACER_2024_MMR_Hydrogen_Markets.pdf) was published in November 2024, assessing regulatory frameworks, supply and demand forecasts and infrastructure needs.
  * ACER provided its [Opinion on the legal setup of the European Network of Network Operators for Hydrogen (ENNOH)](https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Official_documents/Acts_of_the_Agency/Opinions/Opinions/ACER_Opinion_10-2024_ENNOH_Statutory_documents.pdf).


**REMIT enforcement and market surveillance:**
  * Approximately 12 billion transaction records were processed from 106 reporting parties. Coordination of national investigations resulted in fines of about €122 million.
  * Continued operation of the [Market Correction Mechanism (MCM)](https://www.acer.europa.eu/gas/market-correction-mechanism) for daily EU gas reference pricing.
  * A new REMIT Investigations department was established to handle cross-border abuse cases. 
  * Support to the European Commission was provided in drafting REMIT II implementing acts.

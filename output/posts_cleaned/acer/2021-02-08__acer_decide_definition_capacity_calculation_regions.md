## ACER to decide on the definition of capacity calculation regions
## 
What is it about?
​The European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) have received a proposal from all Transmission System Operators (TSOs) for the definition of capacity calculation regions. This proposal envisages all European Union's bidding zone borders to be grouped into different capacity calculation regions, taking into consideration the interdependencies between their cross-zonal capacities. Different regional methodologies (such as capacity calculation, re-dispatching and countertrading) will be applied on the various capacity calculation regions.
An effective coordination between bidding zone borders allows an optimal use of transmission infrastructure across Europe, resulting in positive welfare gains for consumers. These benefits are often determined on the level of capacity calculation regions and the applications of their respective regional methodologies, which is why an efficient determination of the capacity calculation regions is of significant importance to the internal electricity market.
ACER must reach a Decision by 9th May 2021.

## Have your say on Europe’s electricity capacity calculation regions
## 
What is it about?
On 2 July 2025, electricity transmission system operators (TSOs) submitted to ACER their [proposal](https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Official_documents/Public_consultations/PC-2025-E-05/ENTSOE-proposal-CCRs-amendment-2025.pdf) to amend how capacity calculation regions (CCRs) are defined across Europe. ACER is now gathering stakeholder views to inform its assessment.
### **What are capacity calculation regions and why are they important?**
CCRs are cross-border zones where neighbouring TSOs coordinate how much electricity can safely flow between them. This cooperation helps boost cross-border trade, prevent grid congestion and price spikes, and support a more secure, integrated European energy market. 
There are currently nine CCRs in Europe: Nordic, Hansa, Core, Italy North, Central Europe (CE), Greece-Italy (GRIT), South-West Europe (SWE), Baltic and South-East Europe (SEE). They are key to ensuring efficient electricity use, especially as more countries and renewables come into play.
### **What is the amendment about?**
The TSOs are proposing:
  * adding three new CCRs to the South-East Europe region to cover borders with Energy Community countries (East-Central Europe (ECE), Italy-Montenegro (IT-ME) and Eastern Europe (EE)); and
  * merging two existing regions (Core and Italy North) for several regional processes like intraday coordination and congestion management. 


### **Your view matters!**
ACER is assessing whether the TSOs’ proposal supports market integration, ensures efficient use of the grid and supports the well-functioning of the EU electricity market.
To make an informed decision, ACER is organising a [public consultation](https://www.acer.europa.eu/public-consultation/pc2025e05-public-consultation-amendments-electricity-capacity-calculation-regions) from 24 July 2025 to 3 September 2025.

ACER aims to reach a decision by December 2025.

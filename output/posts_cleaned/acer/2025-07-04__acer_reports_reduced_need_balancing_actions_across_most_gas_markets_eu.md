## ACER reports reduced need for balancing actions across most gas markets in the EU
## 
What is it about?
ACER publishes a new [report ](https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/ACER-Gas-Balancing-Indicators-Highlights-2025.pdf)and updates its [interactive dashboard](https://www.acer.europa.eu/media/charts/acer-gas-balancing-dashboard) to showcase main gas balancing trends in the EU for the 2023-2024 gas year. 
### **Keeping Europe’s gas systems balanced efficiently**
The [Gas Balancing Network Code](https://www.acer.europa.eu/gas/network-codes/balancing) establishes market-based rules to ensure efficient balancing of gas supply and demand in European gas balancing zones. For example, it establishes rules that enable and incentivise network users to balance their positions. It also promotes the development of short-term markets by prioritising the use of standard wholesale products when transmission system operators (TSOs) need to manage any remaining system imbalances.
### **What’s the role of ACER?**
Each year, ACER analyses data collected by the European Network for Transmission System Operators for Gas (ENTSOG) to monitor the implementation and effects of the Gas Balancing Network Code across Member States, focusing on:
  * TSOs’ balancing activities;
  * network users’ imbalances;
  * neutrality (i.e. the cost or revenue generated by the balancing regime).


### **What does ACER monitoring show?**
  * **TSOs’ balancing actions have declined across most EU gas balancing zones:** These interventions accounted for a decreasing share of the physical gas market at EU level.
  * **The changing gas market may be reducing the need for balancing**. Lower gas consumption and a smaller physical market may have reduced the need for TSOs to actively balance the system. At the same time, higher gas prices may further incentivise users to stay in balance and avoid charges.


### **What does ACER recommend?**
ACER encourages national regulatory authorities to:
  * Periodically review the performance of their balancing regimes and assess whether their design should be refined or revised.
  * Ensure that incentives for commercial balancing are adequate and explore enhancements to information systems to facilitate network users’ participation.


ACER monitoring, together with market participants’ views (identified through public consultations) and regional cooperation can support regulators in these processes.

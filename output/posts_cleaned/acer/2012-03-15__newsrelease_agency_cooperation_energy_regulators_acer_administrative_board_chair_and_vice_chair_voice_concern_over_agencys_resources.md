Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER): Administrative Board Chair and Vice-Chair voice concern over Agency’s resources **Piotr Woźniak and Razvan Nicolescu,** respectively **re-appointed as Chair and Vice-Chair** of **ACER Administrative Board**. ACER needs to receive adequate resources in order to meet high delivery expectations under EU regulations. ACER **Administrative Board** unanimously re-appointed **Piotr Woźniak, Poland, and Razvan Nicolescu, Romania, as Chair and Vice-Chair** following a proposal by one of its Members, **Detlef Dauke** , Germany, during its 8th meeting in Ljubljana on Wednesday 13 March 2012. Piotr Woźniak and Razvan Nicolescu were designated by the Council of the European Union in 2009 and both have a 6-year mandate as Members of ACER Administrative Board. 
Piotr Woźniak said: ‘I thank all my colleagues of the Administrative Board, Director Alberto Pototschnig, Lord Mogg (Chairman of ACER Board of Regulators), and ACER staff for their confidence, appreciation and excellent cooperation. I am committed to continue serving the Agency, which is becoming one of the pillars of the EU energy sector. I am very proud that since its creation in March 2011 ACER has achieved all the objectives set in its work programme, but new challenges are coming along with the Regulation on Energy Market Integrity and Transparency (REMIT) and the Energy Infrastructure Package. They create new tasks for the Agency while quite a lot remains to be done in order to complete the Internal Energy Market (IEM)’. The re-appointed Vice-Chair, Razvan Nicolescu, Romania, declared: ‘With the Heads of State and Government reiterated commitment to meet the 2014 target for the completion of the IEM, expectations are still very high on what the Agency has to deliver. Having the adequate resources is not only a must, it is essential if one wants to respect decisions taken at the highest political level’.
ACER Administrative Board also welcomed three new appointees: Luis Martin-Oar, and Rene Tammist, designated by the European Parliament, and Stefan Tostmann designated by the European Commission.

ACER’s overall mission is to assist national energy regulatory authorities (NRAs) to perform their duties at EU level and to coordinate their actions whenever necessary. It plays a central role in the integration of the gas and electricity markets, both through the framework guidelines/network codes process and the coordination of Regional Initiatives. ACER issues opinions on ten-year network development plans and controls that these are in line with priorities set at EU level. It is expected to play a central role in the European Infrastructure Package tabled by the European Commission in October 2011. ACER has a general mission in terms of market monitoring and has since December 2011, under REMIT, a very specific responsibility when it comes to wholesale energy trading oversight. ACER has opened its headquarters in Ljubljana, Republic of Slovenia, on 3 March 2011.

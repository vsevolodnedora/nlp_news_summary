## ACER will decide on 2024 European Resource Adequacy Assessment and invites ENTSO-E to streamline future methodology
## 
What is it about?
In April 2025, the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) submitted its [proposal](https://www.entsoe.eu/eraa/2024/downloads/) for the European Resource Adequacy Assessment (ERAA) 2024 to ACER.
### **What is ERAA?**
Mandated by the 2019 [Clean Energy Package](https://www.acer.europa.eu/electricity/about-electricity/clean-energy-package), ERAA is ENTSO-E’s annual evaluation of the risks to the EU’s security of electricity supply for up to 10 years ahead. In line with the [methodology](https://www.acer.europa.eu/Individual%20Decisions_annex/ACER%20Decision%2024-2020%20on%20ERAA%20-%20Annex%20I_1.pdf) approved by ACER in 2020, ENTSO-E must carry out an annual assessment to determine whether the EU has sufficient electricity resources to meet future demand.
At the national level, Member States set their own electricity reliability standards, which indicate the level of security of supply they require. At the European level, ERAA assesses whether the results align with the standards set by the Member States.
### **How does ERAA benefit the EU?**
ERAA provides an objective basis for identifying potential risks to the security of electricity supply in Europe, and whether additional national measures, such as capacity mechanisms, are needed.
### **What is ACER’s role?**
Each year, ACER reviews ENTSO-E’s proposal for ERAA, taking into account the relevant scenarios, assumptions, and results. If approved by ACER, the assessment informs national decisions on the security of electricity supply.
Following ENTSO-E's submission, ACER is conducting its review of the draft ERAA 2024 and will issue its decision in July 2025.
### **Amendment of future ERAA methodology**
In March 2025, ACER was mandated by the European Commission to amend and streamline the methodology for ERAA. This stems from the [Electricity Market Design Reform](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/markets-and-consumers/electricity-market-design_en) (July 2024) and the [European Commission’s report](https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-6803-2025-INIT/en/pdf) (March 2025), both calling for streamlined and simplified application of capacity mechanisms.
To initiate the process, ACER [requested ](https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/en/Electricity/European_Resource_Adequacy_Assessment/ACER-letter-to-ENTSO-E-on-ERAA-streamlining-16042025.pdf)ENTSO-E to propose amendments to the ERAA methodology by mid-October 2025. ACER will then approve or amend the proposal within 3 months of receipt.

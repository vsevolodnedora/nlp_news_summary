## ACER decides on a common methodology for splitting long-term cross-zonal electricity capacity in three Member States
## 
Fostering regional coordination and integration
The European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) publishes today a Decision establishing the common methodology for splitting long-term cross-zonal electricity capacity in Bulga​ria, Greece and Romania (the South East Europe Region). This methodology will foster a coordinated and more integrated usage of long-term capacity in the region.
The application of this methodology will follow the implementation of the long-term capacity calculation methodology for the South East Europe region. The latter was approved on 22 October 2020 by the regulatory authorities of the region, and should be implemented no later than 1 January 2023.

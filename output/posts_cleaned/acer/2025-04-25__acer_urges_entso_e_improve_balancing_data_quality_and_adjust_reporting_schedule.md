What is it about?
ACER has published its [opinion](https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Official_documents/Acts_of_the_Agency/Opinions/Opinions/ACER-Opinion-03-2025-first-amendment-ENTSO-E-monitoring-plan.pdf) on the [amended balancing monitoring plan of the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E)](https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Official_documents/Acts_of_the_Agency/Opinions/Opinions%20Annexes/ACER-Opinion-03-2025-Annex-I.pdf), suggesting more flexible reporting timelines, while stressing the need for improved data quality. 
### **How balancing works and why it needs oversight**
In balancing markets, balancing energy is used to always keep the power system stable by correcting differences between electricity production and consumption. If there is not enough electricity in the system, transmission system operators (TSOs) procure upward balancing energy. If there is too much electricity, TSOs procure downward balancing energy. In most EU countries, this is done via EU platforms for the activation of balancing energy. 
Under the [Electricity Balancing Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2017/2195/oj/eng), ENTSO-E is tasked with overseeing the implementation and integration of balancing mechanisms across the EU. This includes coordinating the use of key platforms for the exchange of balancing energy and providing detailed reports to ACER on progress, efficiency and market integration.
However, delays in some TSOs joining key balancing platforms could hinder the timely publication of monitoring reports, as insufficient operational data may be available for analysis. As a result, ACER has suggested more flexible reporting timelines, while stressing the importance of high-quality balancing data. 
### **What are ACER’s key messages?**
ACER recommends that ENTSO-E:
  * Adopts alternative reporting timelines suggested by ACER.
  * Prioritises the quality of balancing data published on the ENTSO-E Transparency Platform to ensure that national regulators and ACER can effectively conduct their respective monitoring and analyses. 
  * Streamlines reporting and promptly notifies ACER of any overlaps between reporting obligations, without the need to resubmit the amended Monitoring Plan. 


### **What are the next steps?**
ENTSO-E is encouraged to begin improving data quality without delay.
Looking ahead, ACER commits to working closely with ENTSO-E to progressively reduce the number of reports required, aiming for more efficient and focused monitoring processes.

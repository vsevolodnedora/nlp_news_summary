## ACER monitoring reveals limited competition and untapped flexibility in EU retail energy markets 
## 
What is it about?
ACER’s 2025 retail energy country sheets offer a concise overview of the national electricity and gas markets across EU Member States and Norway. For the first time, the country sheets cover both sectors, presenting: 
  * market and competition metrics for electricity and gas; 
  * consumer trends (including contract types, contract switching rates and bill breakdown); 
  * progress towards enabling more flexible consumers (through smart meter roll-out, prosumer participation, deployment of electric vehicles and heat pumps, and biomethane production);
  * a high-level assessment highlighting each market’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT analysis). 


ACER has also updated its [retail pricing dashboard](https://www.acer.europa.eu/media/charts/retail-electricity-and-gas-markets-prices), which shows monthly changes in household energy prices across EU Member States and Norway from January 2019 to June 2025.
### **What are the main findings in retail markets?**
##### **Electricity market**
  * Smart meters, a key enabler for demand-side flexibility, are largely in place across the EU, but roll-out levels vary among EU Member States and Norway. In half of EU Member States, deployment has reached 80%, while in 7, deployment remains below 20% (or no data was provided). 
  * Although 2024 saw an increased number of hours with low wholesale electricity prices (below €5/MWh), fixed price and/or regulated contracts still dominate in 15 Member States at the household level. This widespread uptake limits consumers’ exposure to real-time price signals, preventing cost savings and hindering more innovative and flexible contracts. The limited adoption of dynamic-price contracts suggests that demand-side flexibility potential remains untapped.
  * In 21 Member States, prosumers account for between 1% and 10% of households. The highest shares are observed in Belgium (22%) and the Netherlands (30%). 


##### **Gas market**
  * 82% of residential energy consumption is used for space and water heating, underlining the importance of energy efficiency and building renovation strategies to support decarbonisation.
  * A decline in gas demand has been recorded in 21 Member States since 2022, while biomethane production remains relatively low.


##### **Market structure**
  * Both electricity and gas retail markets show moderate to high concentration across the EU, meaning a small number of suppliers hold a large share of the national market. 
  * 20 Member States either recorded low switching rates (below 10%) or did not provide data, indicating limited competition or low consumer engagement.


The country sheets complement ACER’s retail [Monitoring Report](https://www.acer.europa.eu/monitoring/MMR) (coming in November).
### **Retail prices: Latest trends from ACER’s dashboard**
ACER’s [retail pricing dashboard](https://www.acer.europa.eu/media/charts/retail-electricity-and-gas-markets-prices) highlights the main trends in household electricity and gas prices. 
  * **Electricity prices** across Europe stabilised by June 2025, ending the decline observed since early spring. Spain and Portugal recorded the sharpest monthly rises (+7% and +6%, respectively), followed by more moderate increases in Greece, the Netherlands, Italy and Austria. In contrast, prices declined in Norway (-7%), Estonia (-3%), and in Belgium, Latvia, Sweden and Lithuania (-2%). Most other countries recorded no change. On an annual basis, EU household electricity prices rose by approximately 3%.
  * **Retail gas prices** also remained largely stable, with minor monthly changes: Belgium and Portugal registered small increases (+1%), while Italy recorded the largest decrease (-4%), followed by France and Latvia (-2%), and the Netherlands, Estonia and Austria (-1%). While retail gas prices remained unchanged month-on-month in most Member States, retail offers were approximately 7% higher than those available during the same period last year. 


**What are the main trends in wholesale gas markets?** Prices remained elevated year-on-year but showed little monthly change, despite volatility driven by global trade and security shocks. More information is available in [ACER’s monitoring report on key developments in gas wholesale markets report](https://www.acer.europa.eu/key-developments-european-gas-wholesale-markets-q2-2025), published today.

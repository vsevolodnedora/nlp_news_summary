## Future-ready grids: ACER and CEER set out blueprint for distribution planning
## 
What is it about?
Europe’s clean energy shift is accelerating, and electricity distribution networks must keep pace. From integrating solar panels and electric vehicles to connecting heat pumps and storage, grids need to become more modern, flexible and resilient. To support this, the European Commission’s [Action Plan for Grids](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_6044) tasked ACER and the Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER) with providing guidance on electricity distribution planning. 
[This guidance](https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/ACER-CEER-electricity-distribution-network-planning-guidance-2025.pdf) provides practical recommendations to help national distribution grid operators align with Europe’s decarbonisation goals and turn grid development into a driver, not a barrier, of the clean energy transition. By promoting more coordinated and inclusive planning, the guidance supports the EU [Affordable Energy Action Plan](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/publications/action-plan-affordable-energy-unlocking-true-value-our-energy-union-secure-affordable-efficient-and_en), helping ensure the shift to clean electricity is not only sustainable and secure, but also fair and affordable for all Europeans.
### **Why grid planning needs a rethink**
Distribution networks link homes, businesses and renewables to the wider power grid. Yet most were built for one-way power flows, not today’s decentralised, more flexible generation and fast-growing demand for electricity.
As electrification and renewable growth accelerates, so do the risks of grid bottlenecks and infrastructure development delays. That’s why EU law requires distribution system operators to publish distribution network development plans to outline medium and long-term flexibility needs and investments planned for the next 5-10 years so that the full potential of renewables can be integrated. 
### **What are the key recommendations?**
  * **Look ahead:** Plan at least 10 years ahead and adopt a proactive approach to avoid grid bottlenecks and enable timely investments.
  * **Holistic approach:** For strategic and efficient results, base electricity grid planning on three pillars: scenario development, network needs assessment and project identification.
  * **Balance infrastructure and flexibility:** Address flexibility needs cost-effectively and ensure national distribution plans provide the necessary input for [EU-wide flexibility needs assessment methodology](https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Individual%20Decisions_annex/ACER-Decision-05-2025-FNAM-Annex-I.pdf) (adopted by ACER today).
  * **Enhance transparency and public trust:** Improve stakeholder engagement through structured publication, open consultations and inclusive communication practices.
  * **Coordinate:** Strengthen cooperation among other system operators and align with broader spatial and sectoral planning to ensure system-wide consistency and efficiency.
  * **Regulatory oversight:** National regulators should scrutinise distribution network development, including monitoring the implementation of plans.

## ACER decides methodology for electricity bidding zone review and will evaluate alternative configurations 26.11.2020
## 
What is it about?
The European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) published today a [Decision​](https://www.acer.europa.eu/Official_documents/Acts_of_the_Agency/Pages/Individual-decision.aspx) on the methodology and assumptions to be used in the bidding zone review process and for the alternative bidding zone configurations to be considered, according to the EU Regulation on the internal market for electricity.
The proposed package for the bidding zone review was developed by the Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and was referred to ACER in July 2020 by the relevant regulatory authorities, as a unanimous agreement could not be found.
The Decision of ACER includes two key aspects:
  * Approval of the bidding zone review methodology and assumptions to be used for the bidding zone review process, subject to the necessary amendments.


  * A request to TSOs to provide results derived from a Locational Marginal Pricing (LMP) analysis to enable ACER to take a Decision on alternative bidding zone configurations. ​

## ACER concludes that the proposed gas transmission tariffs for Hungary are largely compliant with EU rules
## 
What is it about?
Today, ACER releases its [report on the Hungarian gas transmission tariffs](https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/ACER_Gas_Tariff_Report_Hungary_2025.pdf) directed at Magyar Energetikai és Közmű-szabályozási Hivatal
The report assesses whether the proposed reference price methodology (RPM) complies with the requirements of the Network Code on Harmonised Transmission Tariff structures ([NC TAR](https://www.acer.europa.eu/gas/network-codes/tariffs)). 
#### **What is the proposed RPM about?**
The NRA proposes to:
  * Apply a postage stamp RPM complemented by a 90% discount at entry points from storage and 100% discounts at exit points from storage. It also suggests applying a 50/50 entry-exit split but is open for adjustments within a 40/60 to 60/40 range subject to stakeholder feedback.
  * Adopt an in-kind flow-based charge (commodity-based tariff). However, taking into consideration inputs received from stakeholders, MEKH already informed ACER about its intent to switch back to a monetary flow-based charge (already in place since 2021).
  * Introduce two non-transmission services, respectively for gas odorisation and for connecting users to the network. 


#### **What are the key findings?**
After analysing the [consultation document](https://www.mekh.hu/fulfilment-of-the-consultation-requirement-set-by-article-26-of-tar-nc-2024), ACER concludes that: 
  * The RPM largely complies with requirements set in Article 7 of the NC TAR. 
  * ACER could not assess the compliance of the proposed flow-based charge, as the relevant NRA decision is only available in Hungarian. However, given MEKH’s intent to switch to a monetary flow-based charge, ACER referred to its [2021 analysis](https://acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/Agency%20report%20-%20analysis%20of%20the%20consultation%20document%20for%20Hungary.pdf), assessing the compliance of the tariffs proposed at that time.
  * The proposed non-transmission services also comply with EU rules. 


#### **What does ACER recommend?**
ACER recommends that the NRA, when adopting its final decision:
  * Ensure the compliance of the commodity-based tariffs with the NC TAR, particularly considering that the monetary flow-based charge will be applied instead of the in-kind one (e.g. stakeholders were consulted upon the latter, but not the former).
  * Reconcile the proposed non-transmission services as required by Article 17(3) of the NC TAR.
